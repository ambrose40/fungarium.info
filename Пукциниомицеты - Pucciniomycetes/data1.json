Rust fungi are highly specialized plant pathogens with several unique features. Taken as a group, rust fungi are diverse and affect many kinds of plants. However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants. In addition, most rust fungi cannot be grown easily in pure culture.\nA single species of rust fungi may be able to infect two different plant hosts in different stages of its life cycle, and may produce up to five morphologically and cytologically distinct spore-producing structures viz., spermogonia, aecia, uredinia, telia, and basidia in successive stages of reproduction. Each spore type is very host specific, and can typically infect only one kind of plant.","dates":{"added":1592685004,"dateRange":{"0":1367656363,"1":1591794236}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.303Z","category":"folder","title":"Пукциниевые - Pucciniales"}],"name":"Пукциниомицеты - Pucciniomycetes","comment":"The Pucciniomycetes (formerly known as the Urediniomycetes) are a class of fungi in the Pucciniomycotina subdivision of the Basidiomycota.
