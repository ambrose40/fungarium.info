It is commonly known as woodland Mollisia, and it is a saprotrophic fungus that decomposes dead wood.\n\nThe fungus grows on decaying wood, producing small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically found in clusters. The fruiting bodies are covered in hairs and can range in color from white to yellowish-brown.\n\nMollisia amenticola is found in various habitats, including forests, woodlands, and grasslands. It plays an essential role in decomposing dead wood and contributing to nutrient cycling within ecosystems.\n\nThe taxonomy and phylogeny of Mollisia amenticola are still not well understood, and further research is needed to fully characterize this species of fungus. Studies have shown that some species within the Dermateaceae family may have potential applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research due to their unique secondary metabolites.\n\nIn summary, Mollisia amenticola is a saprotrophic fungus that decomposes dead wood. It produces small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies and is found in various habitats. Further research is needed to fully understand the taxonomy and potential applications of this species of fungus. Mollisia amenticola plays an essential role in decomposing dead wood and contributing to nutrient cycling within ecosystems.","dates":{"added":1679151037,"dateRange":{"0":1472512460,"1":1679150230}},"fileDate":"2023-03-18T16:46:14.166Z","title":"Mollisia amenticola - Моллизия лесная - Woodland Mollisia - Wald-Schneckling"}
