It is commonly known as black spot fungus and is a plant pathogen that causes a disease known as black spot on various species of roses.\n\nThe fungus attacks the leaves of roses, causing small, round black spots that gradually increase in size and can lead to defoliation. It also affects the stems and flowers of roses, causing cankers and deformations. The disease can cause significant damage to rose gardens and plantations, leading to economic losses in the horticulture industry.\n\nDiplocarpon rosae produces spores that are dispersed by wind or splashing water, allowing the fungus to spread to nearby roses. The spores can survive on infected leaves and stems, allowing the disease to persist from one growing season to the next.\n\nControl measures for Diplocarpon rosae include cultural practices such as pruning and thinning infected roses, as well as fungicides and biological control agents. The disease can be prevented by planting resistant rose cultivars and maintaining proper sanitation practices in rose gardens.\n\nResearch on the ecology, taxonomy, and physiology of Diplocarpon rosae aids in understanding its distribution, virulence, and potential control measures. It has been found that the fungus produces secondary metabolites with potential applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research.\n\nIn summary, Diplocarpon rosae is a plant pathogen that causes black spot on various species of roses. The fungus produces spores that are dispersed by wind or splashing water, and the disease can cause significant damage to rose gardens and plantations. Control measures include cultural practices, fungicides, and biological control agents. Research on this species aids in understanding its ecology, taxonomy, and potential applications.","dates":{"added":1439852902,"dateRange":{"0":1403437130,"1":1403437144}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:58.235Z","title":"Diplocarpon rosae - Диплокарпон розовой пятнистости - Black spot fungus - Echter Rosenrost"}
