девственный - Lachnum virgineum","comment":"Lachnum virgineum is a species of fungus in the family Hyaloscyphaceae, within the order Helotiales of the Ascomycota phylum. It is commonly known as white-haired Lachnum due to its distinctive appearance, characterized by its white, hair-like fruiting bodies.\n\nThe fungus grows on decaying plant material such as leaves, twigs, and fallen wood. The fruiting bodies are typically found growing in clusters, with each individual fruiting body consisting of a tiny, cylindrical-shaped structure covered in white hairs.\n\nLachnum virgineum is a saprotrophic fungus, playing an essential role in decomposing organic matter and contributing to nutrient cycling within ecosystems. It is found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands.\n\nThe taxonomy and phylogeny of Lachnum virgineum are still not well understood, and further research is needed to fully characterize this species of fungus. Studies have shown that some species within the Hyaloscyphaceae family may have potential applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research due to their unique secondary metabolites.\n\nIn summary, Lachnum virgineum is a species of fungus in the family Hyaloscyphaceae, known for its distinctive appearance of white, hair-like fruiting bodies. It is a saprotrophic fungus that contributes to nutrient cycling within ecosystems. Further research is needed to fully understand the taxonomy and potential applications of this species of fungus.","dates":{"added":1679151037,"dateRange":{"0":1301657744,"1":1679149980}},"fileDate":"2023-03-18T16:41:19.592Z","title":"Lachnum virgineum - Лахнум беловойлочный - White-haired Lachnum - Weißhaariger Lachnum"}
