It also affects the cones and bark, causing cankers and galls. The disease can cause significant damage to larch forests and plantations, leading to economic losses in the forestry industry.\n\nLachnellula willkommii produces tiny, cup-shaped fruiting bodies called apothecia, which release spores that infect new larch trees. The spores are dispersed by wind, insects, and animals, allowing the fungus to spread to nearby trees.\n\nControl measures for Lachnellula willkommii include cultural practices such as pruning and thinning infected trees, as well as fungicides and biological control agents. Research on the ecology, taxonomy, and physiology of Lachnellula willkommii aids in understanding its distribution, virulence, and potential control measures.\n\nIn summary, Lachnellula willkommii is a plant pathogen that causes larch blister rust or larch flower rust on various species of larch trees.

This fungus is known to occur in Europe and North America, particularly in temperate regions with a preference for moist habitats. Pezizella alniella primarily grows on decaying wood or the bark of deciduous trees, particularly alder (Alnus) species.\n\nThe fruiting bodies, or apothecia, of Pezizella alniella are small and disc-shaped, typically measuring between 0.5 to 2 mm in diameter. They exhibit a cream or pale beige color, which may darken to light brown with age. The surface of the apothecia is often smooth and somewhat translucent.\n\nThe asci of Pezizella alniella contain eight spores each, similar to other fungi in the Ascomycota phylum. The spores themselves are cylindrical to allantoid (sausage-shaped) and measure approximately 7-9 x 2-3 µm. They are hyaline, meaning they are clear or nearly transparent, which can make them difficult to observe without a microscope.\n\nPezizella alniella is considered to be a saprobic fungus, meaning it derives nutrients from decomposing organic material. In doing so, it plays a vital role in breaking down dead plant matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. This process contributes to the overall health and biodiversity of the forest habitats where it is found.\n\nDue to its minute size and lack of any culinary or medicinal properties, Pezizella alniella is not considered edible. While it is not known to be toxic, there is no incentive for consumption. The primary importance of this fungus lies in its ecological function, and it serves as an intriguing subject for mycologists and naturalists who appreciate the intricate diversity of the fungal world.","dates":{"added":1664561819,"dateRange":{"0":1664546109,"1":1664546189}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:58.213Z","category":"folder","title":"Pezizella alniella - Пецизелла ольховая - Alder Pezizella - Erlen-Pezizella"}],"name":"Гиалосцифовые - Hyaloscyphaceae","comment":"Hyaloscyphaceae is a family of fungi within the order Helotiales of the Ascomycota phylum.
