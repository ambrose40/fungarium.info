This fungus is predominantly found in Europe and North America, inhabiting coniferous and mixed forests with a preference for damp, mossy, and humus-rich areas.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Spathularia flavida are highly distinctive, with a spoon or spatula-shaped fertile head, which is bright yellow in color. The stalk, which can reach 1 to 5 cm in height, is pale to buff at the base and gradually turns yellow towards the head. The fertile head measures 0.5 to 2 cm in width, and its surface is smooth and waxy.\n\nThe asci of Spathularia flavida contain eight spores each, as is characteristic of the Ascomycota phylum. The spores are elliptical in shape, measuring approximately 22-30 x 10-12 µm, and are hyaline, rendering them almost transparent. They possess a distinctive oil droplet in their center, which is a notable feature of this species.\n\nSpathularia flavida is classified as a saprobic fungus, feeding on decaying organic matter. Its primary ecological role is the decomposition of plant debris, particularly dead wood, which helps to recycle nutrients back into the forest ecosystem. This process is essential for maintaining a healthy environment and promoting biodiversity.\n\nWhile Spathularia flavida is not considered toxic, its small size, fibrous texture, and lack of appealing flavors deem it inedible. This fungus is best appreciated for its unique morphology and ecological importance, rather than its potential as a culinary ingredient. It is an intriguing species for mycologists, naturalists, and photographers, who are drawn to the vibrant color and unusual form of the Yellow Earth Tongue.","dates":{"added":1664064137,"dateRange":{"0":1663595430,"1":1664013111}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:54:02.292Z","category":"folder","title":"Spathularia flavida - Спатулярия желтоватая - Yellow Earth Tongue - Gelbe Löffelflechte"}],"name":"Кудониевые - Cudoniaceae","comment":"Cudoniaceae is a family of fungi within the order Agaricales of the Basidiomycota phylum.
