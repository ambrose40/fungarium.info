These fungi are commonly found in Europe and North America, predominantly inhabiting deciduous forests. They grow on fallen catkins, particularly those from alder (Alnus) and hazel (Corylus) trees, providing a vital role in the decomposition of organic matter.\n\nCiboria amentacea typically appears in late winter to early spring, flourishing in cool, moist environments. Its fruiting bodies, or apothecia, are characterized by a cup-shaped structure, ranging from 3 to 15 mm in diameter. They are dark brown or black in color, with a wrinkled surface, giving them a distinctive appearance.\n\nThe asci, or spore-producing cells, of Ciboria amentacea contain eight spores each. These spores are ellipsoid to elongate-ellipsoid in shape, measuring 10-17 x 5-8 µm, and are transparent to pale brown in color. The outer layer of the ascus, known as the ascus wall, is equipped with a special apical apparatus, which helps in releasing the spores during reproduction.\n\nCiboria amentacea is not considered edible due to its small size and lack of desirable flavors. While it is not toxic, consumption is not recommended. As a decomposer, this fungus plays a crucial role in the forest ecosystem by breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients, thereby supporting plant growth and overall biodiversity.","dates":{"added":1710623416,"dateRange":{"0":1520358658,"1":1710622792}},"fileDate":"2024-03-16T23:04:14.792Z","category":"folder","title":"Ciboria amentacea - Цибория желудевидная - Alder Ciboria - Haselbecherchen"},{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Encoelia%20furfuracea","deepCounters":{"total":25,"images":25,"files":25},"counters":{"total":25,"images":25,"files":25},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Encoelia%20furfuracea\/thumbs\/2024-03-16-07.02.46%20ZS%20PMax.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3> Encoelia furfuracea - Энцелия шелушистая - Spring Hazelcup - Hasel-Kleiebecherling<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Encoelia furfuracea is a species of fungus known for its distinctive appearance and ecological role.

It typically has small fruiting bodies with caps ranging from 0.5 to 2 centimeters in diameter. The caps are irregularly shaped and covered with fine, powdery granules, giving them a dusty or mealy appearance. The coloration of the caps can vary but often ranges from tan to brown.\n\nThis fungus is commonly found growing on decaying wood, particularly hardwoods such as oak and beech, in temperate forests. It plays a vital role in the decomposition of woody debris, helping to recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. Encoelia furfuracea has a wide distribution and can be found in various parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nChemically, Encoelia furfuracea produces various compounds, some of which may have potential applications in medicine or industry. Research into the bioactive compounds produced by this fungus is ongoing and may uncover new therapeutic or industrial uses.\n\nThe spores of Encoelia furfuracea are typically released from specialized structures called asci, which are contained within fruiting bodies. These spores are dispersed by wind or other means, allowing the fungus to colonize new habitats and continue its life cycle.\n\nWhile Encoelia furfuracea is not generally considered to be edible, it is an intriguing subject for fungal enthusiasts and researchers due to its unique morphology and ecological importance. As with all wild fungi, proper identification is essential before consumption to avoid potential health risks.","dates":{"added":1710623416,"dateRange":{"0":1710593007,"1":1710622764}},"fileDate":"2024-03-16T23:10:16.713Z","category":"folder","title":" Encoelia furfuracea - Энцелия шелушистая - Spring Hazelcup - Hasel-Kleiebecherling"}],"name":"Склеротиниевые - Sclerotiniaceae","comment":"Sclerotiniaceae is a family of fungi within the order Helotiales of the Ascomycota phylum.
