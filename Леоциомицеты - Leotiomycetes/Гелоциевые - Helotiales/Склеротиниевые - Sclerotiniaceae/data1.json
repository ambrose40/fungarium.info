These fungi are commonly found in Europe and North America, predominantly inhabiting deciduous forests. They grow on fallen catkins, particularly those from alder (Alnus) and hazel (Corylus) trees, providing a vital role in the decomposition of organic matter.\n\nCiboria amentacea typically appears in late winter to early spring, flourishing in cool, moist environments. Its fruiting bodies, or apothecia, are characterized by a cup-shaped structure, ranging from 3 to 15 mm in diameter. They are dark brown or black in color, with a wrinkled surface, giving them a distinctive appearance.\n\nThe asci, or spore-producing cells, of Ciboria amentacea contain eight spores each. These spores are ellipsoid to elongate-ellipsoid in shape, measuring 10-17 x 5-8 µm, and are transparent to pale brown in color. The outer layer of the ascus, known as the ascus wall, is equipped with a special apical apparatus, which helps in releasing the spores during reproduction.\n\nCiboria amentacea is not considered edible due to its small size and lack of desirable flavors. While it is not toxic, consumption is not recommended. As a decomposer, this fungus plays a crucial role in the forest ecosystem by breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients, thereby supporting plant growth and overall biodiversity.","dates":{"added":1680916161,"dateRange":{"0":1520358658,"1":1680440277}},"fileDate":"2023-04-07T18:54:50.52Z","category":"folder","title":"Ciboria amentacea - Цибория желудевидная - Alder Ciboria - Haselbecherchen"}],"name":"Склеротиниевые - Sclerotiniaceae","comment":"Sclerotiniaceae is a family of fungi within the order Helotiales of the Ascomycota phylum.
