It is commonly known as cylindrical jelly club due to its long, cylindrical-shaped fruiting bodies, which are gelatinous and jelly-like in texture. The fruiting bodies are typically brownish-yellow in color and can be found growing on decaying wood and bark of various deciduous trees.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Ascocoryne cylichnium are elongated and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a diameter of 2-5mm. They contain the asci, which produce spores known as ascospores. The spores are ejected explosively from the asci and can be dispersed by wind or other means.\n\nAscocoryne cylichnium is a saprotrophic fungus that plays a significant role in decomposing wood, contributing to nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. It can be found growing in both temperate and tropical regions, although its distribution is not well understood in some areas.\n\nWhile Ascocoryne cylichnium is not toxic, it is not considered an edible species due to its small size and gelatinous texture. Its unique shape and appearance make it an interesting subject for photographers and naturalists.\n\nControl measures for plant pathogens within the Helotiaceae family, including Ascocoryne cylichnium, may include cultural practices, fungicides, and biological control agents. Research on the ecology, taxonomy, and physiology of Ascocoryne cylichnium aids in understanding its ecological roles and potential applications in agriculture, forestry, and environmental conservation.\n\nIn summary, Ascocoryne cylichnium is a unique and visually interesting fungus that plays an essential role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. Its spores are explosively ejected from the asci and can be dispersed by wind or other means. While not of significant economic importance, Ascocoryne cylichnium is a fascinating subject for photographers and naturalists.","dates":{"added":1631723361,"dateRange":{"0":1283952719,"1":1283952719}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:54.189Z","title":"Ascocoryne cylichnium - Аскокорина цилиндрическая - Cylindrical Jelly Club - Zylindrischer Kelchbecherling"}
