This diverse group of fungi is characterized by its members' ecological roles as plant pathogens, saprobes, or endophytes, and their unique fruiting bodies, which often display conspicuous structures.\n\nFungi within the Rhytismatales order produce fruiting bodies known as apothecia, which are typically disk- or cup-shaped structures that vary in size, color, and morphology. These apothecia produce asci, the spore-producing cells characteristic of the Ascomycota phylum. Each ascus generally contains eight spores, although this may vary depending on the species.\n\nMembers of the Rhytismatales order exhibit diverse host preferences, with some species having a narrow host range while others are more generalist in nature. They often cause leaf spot diseases, needle blights, and other foliar infections in a wide variety of plants, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. Some species, however, function as saprobes or endophytes, decomposing dead plant material or living within plant tissues without causing harm, respectively.\n\nNotable families within the Rhytismatales order include the Rhytismataceae and Melogrammataceae families. Rhytismataceae contains species like Rhytisma acerinum, which causes the distinctive tar spot disease on maple and sycamore trees, while Melogrammataceae includes fungi like Melogramma campylosporum, a saprobe found on decaying wood.\n\nWhile the diseases caused by Rhytismatales fungi can be unsightly and sometimes result in reduced growth or premature leaf drop, they rarely cause significant long-term damage to the host plants. In most cases, control measures, such as the removal of infected leaves or the use of fungicides, are not necessary.\n\nThe Rhytismatales order is a fascinating group of fungi that contribute to the intricate relationships between plants and fungi within ecosystems. These fungi serve as important subjects of study for plant pathologists, mycologists, and naturalists who seek to understand their role in plant health and disease dynamics. Additionally, the Rhytismatales order offers insights into the complex world of fungal diversity and the various ecological roles fungi play in nature.","dates":{"added":1665945060,"dateRange":{"0":1285928180,"1":1682270464}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.266Z","category":"folder","title":"Ритисмовые - Rhytismatales"},{"path":"%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Erysiphales","deepCounters":{"total":34,"images":29,"folders":5,"files":29},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Erysiphales\/%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Erysiphaceae\/%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B5%20%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Erysiphe%20cichoracearum\/thumbs\/DSC05925.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Эризифовые - Erysiphales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Erysiphales is an order of fungi within the class Leotiomycetes of the Ascomycota phylum.

This group of fungi is characterized by its members' distinct ecological roles as obligate biotrophic plant pathogens, meaning they require living host tissue to survive and reproduce. Members of the Erysiphales order are commonly known as powdery mildews, due to the white, powdery appearance they create on the surface of infected plant tissues.\n\nFungi within the Erysiphales order produce fruiting bodies called cleistothecia, which are small, closed, spherical structures that house the asci, the spore-producing cells characteristic of the Ascomycota phylum. Each ascus typically contains eight spores, although this may vary depending on the species. These spores, called ascospores, are forcibly discharged from the cleistothecia and dispersed by wind to infect new host plants.\n\nMembers of the Erysiphales order exhibit diverse host preferences, with some species having a narrow host range while others are more generalist in nature. They infect a wide variety of plants, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, causing powdery mildew diseases that affect the leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. These diseases can lead to reduced photosynthesis, plant growth, and crop yield, making them of significant concern in agriculture and horticulture.\n\nThe most notable family within the Erysiphales order is the Erysiphaceae family, which contains genera such as Erysiphe, Podosphaera, and Golovinomyces. These genera include species like Erysiphe necator, which causes powdery mildew on grapevines, and Podosphaera xanthii, responsible for powdery mildew in cucurbits.\n\nControl measures for powdery mildews include cultural practices, such as providing adequate air circulation and avoiding excess nitrogen fertilization, as well as the use of resistant plant varieties, fungicides, and biological control agents.\n\nThe Erysiphales order is an important group of fungi that contribute to the complex relationships between plants and fungi within ecosystems.
