This species is characterized by its hemispherical, hairy fruiting bodies and its preference for growing on decaying wood.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of H. hemisphaerica are typically 1 to 4 cm in diameter and are covered with fine, whitish or grayish hairs on the outer surface. The inner surface is smooth and ranges in color from pale cream to light brown.\n\nHumaria hemisphaerica is a saprobic fungus, playing a crucial role in breaking down dead organic matter, particularly decaying wood, and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.\n\nThis species prefers to grow on decaying hardwood, such as beech and oak, in temperate forests. It can be found both on fallen logs and stumps and directly on the forest floor.\n\nHumaria hemisphaerica has a wide distribution across Europe, North America, and Asia, but it is considered to be relatively rare in most regions.\n\nThe spores of H. hemisphaerica are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure about 18-25 x 10-15 µm. They are produced in asci, which are the sac-like structures that contain spores within the apothecium.\n\nThe chemistry of Humaria hemisphaerica has not been thoroughly investigated, but it is assumed to contain various secondary metabolites common to the Pyronemataceae family.\n\nH. hemisphaerica is not considered edible and has no known culinary value.\n\nThis species is often confused with other cup fungi, such as Humaria granulata, which has a similar appearance but a less hairy outer surface.\n\nResearch on Humaria hemisphaerica is limited, and further studies are needed to better understand its ecology, distribution, and potential uses.\n\nConservation efforts for H. hemisphaerica should focus on preserving the habitats in which it is found, as some populations might be threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation.\n\nProper identification of Humaria hemisphaerica and other similar species is essential for ecological research and for foragers interested in collecting cup fungi.","dates":{"added":1472860277,"dateRange":{"0":1284096053,"1":1285327044}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:54:16.684Z","title":"Humaria hemisphaerica - Гумария полушаровидная - Hairy Fairy Cup - Haarige Feenschale"}
