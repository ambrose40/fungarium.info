   		<description>Aleuria rhenana, commonly known as the Rhenish Orange Peel Fungus or Rheinischer Orangenschalenpilz in German, is a species of cup fungi belonging to the Pyronemataceae family. This species is known for its distinctive orange, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that resemble orange peels.

The fruiting bodies of A. rhenana can reach up to 5 cm in diameter and have a smooth, bright orange to yellowish-orange upper surface. The outer surface is paler and slightly fuzzy, with a white to cream color.

Aleuria rhenana is saprobic, meaning it decomposes dead organic matter, particularly plant debris and leaf litter. This makes it an important contributor to nutrient cycling in its environment.

The habitat of A. rhenana typically includes forests, grasslands, and other areas with abundant plant debris. It is often found growing on the ground, but can also appear on decaying wood.

The distribution of A. rhenana is primarily in Europe, but it has also been reported in North America and Asia.

The spores of A. rhenana are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure around 18-23 x 10-13 µm. They are produced in asci, which are sac-like structures within the apothecium.

The chemistry of A. rhenana has not been thoroughly investigated, but it is presumed to contain various secondary metabolites typical of fungi in the Pyronemataceae family.

Aleuria rhenana is not considered edible, and its taste and edibility have not been widely reported.

The Rhenish Orange Peel Fungus is often confused with other orange or yellow cup fungi, such as Aleuria aurantia, which has a similar appearance but typically has larger fruiting bodies.

Research on A. rhenana is limited, and further studies are needed to better understand its ecology, distribution, and potential uses.

Conservation efforts should focus on protecting the habitats where A. rhenana is found, as some populations may be threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation.

Proper identification of A. rhenana and other similar-looking species is crucial for ecological studies and for those interested in foraging for cup fungi.</description>
