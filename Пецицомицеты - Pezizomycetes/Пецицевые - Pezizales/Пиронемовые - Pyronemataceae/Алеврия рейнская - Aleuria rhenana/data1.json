This species is known for its distinctive orange, cup-shaped fruiting bodies that resemble orange peels.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of A. rhenana can reach up to 5 cm in diameter and have a smooth, bright orange to yellowish-orange upper surface. The outer surface is paler and slightly fuzzy, with a white to cream color.\n\nAleuria rhenana is saprobic, meaning it decomposes dead organic matter, particularly plant debris and leaf litter. This makes it an important contributor to nutrient cycling in its environment.\n\nThe habitat of A. rhenana typically includes forests, grasslands, and other areas with abundant plant debris. It is often found growing on the ground, but can also appear on decaying wood.\n\nThe distribution of A. rhenana is primarily in Europe, but it has also been reported in North America and Asia.\n\nThe spores of A. rhenana are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure around 18-23 x 10-13 µm. They are produced in asci, which are sac-like structures within the apothecium.\n\nThe chemistry of A. rhenana has not been thoroughly investigated, but it is presumed to contain various secondary metabolites typical of fungi in the Pyronemataceae family.\n\nAleuria rhenana is not considered edible, and its taste and edibility have not been widely reported.\n\nThe Rhenish Orange Peel Fungus is often confused with other orange or yellow cup fungi, such as Aleuria aurantia, which has a similar appearance but typically has larger fruiting bodies.\n\nResearch on A. rhenana is limited, and further studies are needed to better understand its ecology, distribution, and potential uses.\n\nConservation efforts should focus on protecting the habitats where A. rhenana is found, as some populations may be threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation.\n\nProper identification of A. rhenana and other similar-looking species is crucial for ecological studies and for those interested in foraging for cup fungi.","dates":{"added":1451843149,"dateRange":{"0":1284300497,"1":1284300497}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:54:16.669Z","title":"Aleuria rhenana - Алеврия рейнская - Orange peel cup fungus - Rheinbecherling"}
