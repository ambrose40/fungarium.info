They can be encountered in a variety of habitats, such as forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas, depending on the specific species.\n\nMembers of the Helvellaceae family often form ectomycorrhizal relationships with trees, especially conifers and hardwoods. This symbiotic association benefits both the fungus and the host tree by facilitating nutrient exchange.\n\nSome species in the Helvellaceae family are considered edible, while others are toxic or inedible. It is essential to accurately identify these fungi to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes.\n\nOne well-known species within this family is Gyromitra esculenta, which is known to contain the toxin gyromitrin. Consumption of this species can lead to severe gastrointestinal distress, liver and kidney damage, and even death.\n\nOn the other hand, some species of Helvella, such as H. crispa and H. lacunosa, are considered edible when cooked, although their edibility remains a matter of debate among mycologists and foragers.\n\nSpore morphology and size can vary within the Helvellaceae family, but they are generally elliptical, smooth, and colorless.\n\nMembers of the Helvellaceae family have been used traditionally for various medicinal purposes, although scientific research supporting these uses is limited.\n\nFruiting bodies of Helvellaceae fungi typically appear during spring and fall, depending on the species and local environmental conditions.\n\nThe taxonomy of the Helvellaceae family has undergone numerous revisions, with molecular studies providing new insights into the relationships between genera and species.\n\nSome Helvellaceae fungi demonstrate potential for use in bioremediation, as they can accumulate heavy metals and other contaminants from their environment.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have been investigating the potential of Helvellaceae fungi as sources of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical and industrial applications.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to protect the habitats and ecosystems supporting Helvellaceae fungi, as many species are sensitive to environmental changes and human disturbance.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1283954473,"1":1683109881}},"fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:20:24.327Z","category":"folder","title":"Helvellaceae - Гельвелловые - Helvellas - Lorcheln"},{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Discinaceae","deepCounters":{"total":68,"images":64,"folders":4,"files":64},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Discinaceae\/%D0%94%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D1%89%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Discina%20ancilis\/thumbs\/DSC07387.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Discinaceae - Дисциновые - False Morels - Schein-Morchelverwandte<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Discinaceae family, also known as False Morels or Schein-Morchelverwandte in German, belongs to the Ascomycota phylum of fungi.

This family comprises several genera, including Gyromitra, Discina, and Hydnotrya. The members of Discinaceae are mostly characterized by their distinctive, irregularly shaped, and often brain-like or convoluted cap appearance.\n\nSpecies in the Discinaceae family are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. They usually grow in various forest habitats, forming mycorrhizal associations with trees such as conifers and broadleaf species.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Discinaceae fungi can appear in spring or autumn, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Some species, like Gyromitra esculenta, are known to fruit after snowmelt in early spring.\n\nThe caps of Discinaceae mushrooms can vary greatly in size, shape, and color, ranging from small, cup-shaped structures to large, convoluted masses. The colors can also vary from brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown.\n\nWhile some species in the Discinaceae family are considered edible and even prized in certain regions, others are known to be toxic. For example, Gyromitra esculenta contains the toxin gyromitrin, which can be lethal if ingested in large quantities.\n\nSpore-producing structures in Discinaceae fungi are called asci, which are typically cylindrical or club-shaped. The spores themselves are usually hyaline, smooth, and ellipsoid, measuring between 15-30 x 5-10 micrometers, depending on the species.\n\nThe microscopic structure of Discinaceae fungi is characterized by the presence of paraphyses, which are sterile, elongated cells interspersed among the asci. These paraphyses can be branched or unbranched, septate or aseptate, and may contain pigments.\n\nResearch on the ecology and biology of Discinaceae fungi is still ongoing, and new species are occasionally discovered. In recent years, molecular phylogenetic studies have helped refine the classification of these fungi and shed light on their evolutionary relationships.\n\nIn addition to their ecological roles as mycorrhizal partners and decomposers, some species in the Discinaceae family have been investigated for their potential medicinal properties. For example, certain compounds isolated from Gyromitra species have shown cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.\n\nIt is important to exercise caution when foraging for mushrooms in the Discinaceae family, as some species can be easily confused with the true morels (Morchella spp.), which are highly prized edible fungi. False morels can be distinguished by their irregularly shaped, convoluted caps, and the absence of a honeycomb-like pattern found in true morels.","dates":{"added":1592685004,"dateRange":{"0":1253867873,"1":1588525485}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.618Z","category":"folder","title":"Discinaceae - Дисциновые - False Morels - Schein-Morchelverwandte"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pezizaceae","deepCounters":{"total":30,"images":25,"folders":5,"files":25},"counters":{"total":5,"folders":5},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pezizaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Peziza%20varia\/thumbs\/DSC08192.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Pezizaceae - Пецицевые - Cup Fungi - Becherlingsverwandte<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Pezizaceae family, known as Cup Fungi or Becherlingsverwandte in German, is a group of fungi belonging to the Ascomycota phylum.
