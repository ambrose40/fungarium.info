This distinctive fungus features a cup-shaped or goblet-shaped fruiting body, usually ranging from 3 to 10 cm in diameter.\n\nThe exterior of the fruiting body is brownish-gray to black, while the interior is a lighter gray. The upper margin of the cup is often irregular, with lobes or folds, giving the fungus a unique appearance.\n\nThe stem of H. acetabulum is typically 4-10 cm long and 1-2 cm thick, and it is hollow, ridged, and wrinkled. The color of the stem can vary from whitish-gray to brownish-black.\n\nHelvella acetabulum is a saprobic fungus, playing a vital role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems. It is often found in deciduous and mixed forests, particularly in areas with abundant leaf litter or woody debris.\n\nThis fungus has a wide geographic distribution, spanning across North America, Europe, and Asia. In some regions, it is more commonly found at higher elevations.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of H. acetabulum typically appear from late summer to autumn, depending on the region and local climate conditions.\n\nThe spores of Helvella acetabulum are elliptical, hyaline, and contain multiple oil droplets. They measure approximately 18-22 x 10-12 micrometers in size.\n\nAscospores are produced in asci, which are sac-like structures within the fruiting body, and are forcibly discharged into the air for dispersal.\n\nAlthough the Vinegar Cup is not considered poisonous, it is generally regarded as inedible due to its tough, leathery texture and unappealing taste.\n\nThere is limited information regarding the chemical compounds present in H. acetabulum, but similar species within the Helvellaceae family are known to contain various secondary metabolites.\n\nHelvella acetabulum has not been extensively studied for its potential medicinal properties, but research on related species suggests that some members of the Helvellaceae family may possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antimicrobial activities.\n\nIt is essential to accurately identify H. acetabulum, as some other cup fungi within the Helvellaceae family can be toxic.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1683107703,"1":1683109881}},"fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:47:04.737Z","category":"folder","title":"Helvella acetabulum - Лопастник бокальчатый - Vinegar Cup - Essigbecher-Helmling"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20lacunosa","deepCounters":{"total":2,"images":2,"files":2},"counters":{"total":2,"images":2,"files":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20lacunosa\/thumbs\/fungi-0004148.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Helvella lacunosa - Лопастник бороздчатый - Fluted Black Elfin Saddle - Gefurchter Lerchensporn<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Helvella lacunosa, also known as the Fluted Black Elfin Saddle or Gefurchter Lerchensporn in German, is a species of fungi belonging to the Helvellaceae family.&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Лопастник бороздчатый - Helvella lacunosa","comment":"Helvella lacunosa, also known as the Fluted Black Elfin Saddle or Gefurchter Lerchensporn in German, is a species of fungi belonging to the Helvellaceae family.
