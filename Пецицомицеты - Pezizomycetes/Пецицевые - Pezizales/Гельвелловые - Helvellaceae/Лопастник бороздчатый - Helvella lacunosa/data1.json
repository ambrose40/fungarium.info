This fungus is characterized by its dark, saddle-shaped fruiting body with deep, irregular flutes and grooves.\n\nThe cap of H. lacunosa is typically 2-6 cm wide and 2-5 cm tall, with a convoluted, irregularly lobed surface. The cap's color can vary from dark gray to black, often becoming darker with age.\n\nThe stem of this mushroom is 3-10 cm long and 1-3 cm thick, with a hollow, chambered structure. The stem is usually grayish-white to pale gray, with deep, longitudinal grooves running along its length.\n\nHelvella lacunosa is commonly found in Europe and North America, particularly in temperate regions. It is primarily associated with hardwood forests, especially in the vicinity of oak and beech trees.\n\nThis species forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with its host trees, facilitating nutrient exchange between the fungus and the tree. This symbiotic association benefits both organisms and plays a critical role in forest ecosystems.\n\nH. lacunosa typically fruits during late summer and autumn, with its fruiting bodies often appearing after rainfall.\n\nThe spores of Helvella lacunosa are elliptical, smooth, and colorless, measuring approximately 17-21 x 10-13 micrometers in size.\n\nAlthough some sources consider H. lacunosa to be edible when cooked, its edibility remains a matter of debate. Caution is advised, as the mushroom contains small amounts of the toxin gyromitrin, which can cause adverse effects when consumed.\n\nDespite its debated edibility, the mushroom is not considered to be of significant culinary value due to its relatively mild flavor and rubbery texture.\n\nHelvella lacunosa has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited.\n\nThis species has been the subject of recent research investigating its potential applications in bioremediation, as it can accumulate heavy metals from its environment.\n\nIn some regions, Helvella lacunosa is considered a rare or threatened species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its habitat and maintain healthy forest ecosystems.","dates":{"added":1451767781,"dateRange":{"0":1285242569,"1":1285242603}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:54:13.584Z","title":"Helvella lacunosa - Лопастник бороздчатый - Fluted Black Elfin Saddle - Gefurchter Lerchensporn"}
