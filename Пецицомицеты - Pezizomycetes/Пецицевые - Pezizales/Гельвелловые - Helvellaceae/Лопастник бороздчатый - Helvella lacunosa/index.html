		<title>Helvella lacunosa - Лопастник бороздчатый - Fluted Black Elfin Saddle - Gefurchter Lerchensporn</title>
		<meta name="description" content="Helvella lacunosa, also known as the Fluted Black Elfin Saddle or Gefurchter Lerchensporn in German, is a species of fungi belonging to the Helvellaceae family. This fungus is characterized by its dark, saddle-shaped fruiting body with deep, irregular flutes and grooves. The cap of H. lacunosa is typically 2-6 cm wide and 2-5 cm tall, with a convoluted, irregularly lobed surface. The cap's color can vary from dark gray to black, often becoming darker with age. The stem of this mushroom is 3-10 cm long and 1-3 cm thick, with a hollow, chambered structure. The stem is usually grayish-white to pale gray, with deep, longitudinal grooves running along its length. Helvella lacunosa is commonly found in Europe and North America, particularly in temperate regions. It is primarily associated with hardwood forests, especially in the vicinity of oak and beech trees. This species forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with its host trees, facilitating nutrient exchange between the fungus and the tree. This symbiotic association benefits both organisms and plays a critical role in forest ecosystems. H. lacunosa typically fruits during late summer and autumn, with its fruiting bodies often appearing after rainfall. The spores of Helvella lacunosa are elliptical, smooth, and colorless, measuring approximately 17-21 x 10-13 micrometers in size. Although some sources consider H. lacunosa to be edible when cooked, its edibility remains a matter of debate. Caution is advised, as the mushroom contains small amounts of the toxin gyromitrin, which can cause adverse effects when consumed. Despite its debated edibility, the mushroom is not considered to be of significant culinary value due to its relatively mild flavor and rubbery texture. Helvella lacunosa has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited. This species has been the subject of recent research investigating its potential applications in bioremediation, as it can accumulate heavy metals from its environment. In some regions, Helvella lacunosa is considered a rare or threatened species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its habitat and maintain healthy forest ecosystems.">

This fungus is characterized by its dark, saddle-shaped fruiting body with deep, irregular flutes and grooves.

The cap of H. lacunosa is typically 2-6 cm wide and 2-5 cm tall, with a convoluted, irregularly lobed surface. The cap's color can vary from dark gray to black, often becoming darker with age.

The stem of this mushroom is 3-10 cm long and 1-3 cm thick, with a hollow, chambered structure. The stem is usually grayish-white to pale gray, with deep, longitudinal grooves running along its length.

Helvella lacunosa is commonly found in Europe and North America, particularly in temperate regions. It is primarily associated with hardwood forests, especially in the vicinity of oak and beech trees.

This species forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with its host trees, facilitating nutrient exchange between the fungus and the tree. This symbiotic association benefits both organisms and plays a critical role in forest ecosystems.

H. lacunosa typically fruits during late summer and autumn, with its fruiting bodies often appearing after rainfall.

The spores of Helvella lacunosa are elliptical, smooth, and colorless, measuring approximately 17-21 x 10-13 micrometers in size.

Although some sources consider H. lacunosa to be edible when cooked, its edibility remains a matter of debate. Caution is advised, as the mushroom contains small amounts of the toxin gyromitrin, which can cause adverse effects when consumed.

Despite its debated edibility, the mushroom is not considered to be of significant culinary value due to its relatively mild flavor and rubbery texture.

Helvella lacunosa has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited.

This species has been the subject of recent research investigating its potential applications in bioremediation, as it can accumulate heavy metals from its environment.

In some regions, Helvella lacunosa is considered a rare or threatened species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its habitat and maintain healthy forest ecosystems.</div></div></div></div></div>
