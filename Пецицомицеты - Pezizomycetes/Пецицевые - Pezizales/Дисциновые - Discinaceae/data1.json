This ascomycete fungus is characterized by its distinct shield-like or saddle-shaped fruiting body, which can reach up to 8 cm in diameter.\n\nThe cap of D. ancilis is typically reddish-brown or dark brown in color and has a smooth, waxy surface. The margins of the cap are often wavy or irregular, contributing to the shield-like appearance.\n\nThe underside of the cap in D. ancilis does not have gills or pores; instead, it is smooth or slightly wrinkled, with a lighter coloration than the upper surface. The stipe, or stem, is short, thick, and often off-center, with a similar color to the cap.\n\nDiscina ancilis is commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe. It typically grows on the ground in mixed or coniferous forests, often near decaying wood or in mossy areas.\n\nThe fruiting period for D. ancilis usually occurs in spring, sometimes extending into early summer, depending on environmental conditions and geographical location.\n\nThe spores of D. ancilis are ellipsoid and hyaline, measuring approximately 20-25 x 7-10 micrometers. The asci, or spore-producing structures, are cylindrical or club-shaped, containing eight spores each.\n\nMicroscopically, D. ancilis features paraphyses, which are elongated, sterile cells interspersed among the asci. These paraphyses are septate and may contain pigments.\n\nDespite its intriguing appearance, D. ancilis is not considered an edible mushroom due to its tough, leathery texture and lack of appealing flavor. It is not known to be toxic, but it is not recommended for consumption.\n\nDiscina ancilis plays an important ecological role as a decomposer, helping to break down organic material in the forest ecosystem. It forms mycorrhizal associations with trees, which is beneficial for both the fungus and the host plant.\n\nThe Shield-like Discina is not a well-studied species, and further research is needed to better understand its biology, distribution, and ecological significance.","dates":{"added":1555948303,"dateRange":{"0":1555676457,"1":1555677522}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:54:14.243Z","category":"folder","title":"Discina ancilis - Дисцина щитовидная - Shield-like Discina - Schildförmige Discina"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Gyromitra%20gigas","deepCounters":{"total":18,"images":18,"files":18},"counters":{"total":18,"images":18,"files":18},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Gyromitra%20gigas\/thumbs\/DSC02473.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Gyromitra gigas - Строчок гигантский - Snowbank False Morel - Riesen-Lorchel<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Gyromitra gigas, commonly known as the Snowbank False Morel or Riesen-Lorchel in German, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Discinaceae.

They usually grow in various forest habitats, forming mycorrhizal associations with trees such as conifers and broadleaf species.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Discinaceae fungi can appear in spring or autumn, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Some species, like Gyromitra esculenta, are known to fruit after snowmelt in early spring.\n\nThe caps of Discinaceae mushrooms can vary greatly in size, shape, and color, ranging from small, cup-shaped structures to large, convoluted masses. The colors can also vary from brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown.\n\nWhile some species in the Discinaceae family are considered edible and even prized in certain regions, others are known to be toxic. For example, Gyromitra esculenta contains the toxin gyromitrin, which can be lethal if ingested in large quantities.\n\nSpore-producing structures in Discinaceae fungi are called asci, which are typically cylindrical or club-shaped. The spores themselves are usually hyaline, smooth, and ellipsoid, measuring between 15-30 x 5-10 micrometers, depending on the species.\n\nThe microscopic structure of Discinaceae fungi is characterized by the presence of paraphyses, which are sterile, elongated cells interspersed among the asci. These paraphyses can be branched or unbranched, septate or aseptate, and may contain pigments.\n\nResearch on the ecology and biology of Discinaceae fungi is still ongoing, and new species are occasionally discovered. In recent years, molecular phylogenetic studies have helped refine the classification of these fungi and shed light on their evolutionary relationships.\n\nIn addition to their ecological roles as mycorrhizal partners and decomposers, some species in the Discinaceae family have been investigated for their potential medicinal properties. For example, certain compounds isolated from Gyromitra species have shown cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.\n\nIt is important to exercise caution when foraging for mushrooms in the Discinaceae family, as some species can be easily confused with the true morels (Morchella spp.), which are highly prized edible fungi. False morels can be distinguished by their irregularly shaped, convoluted caps, and the absence of a honeycomb-like pattern found in true morels.","dates":{"added":1592685004,"dateRange":{"0":1253867873,"1":1588525485}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.618Z","title":"Discinaceae - Дисциновые - False Morels - Schein-Morchelverwandte"}
