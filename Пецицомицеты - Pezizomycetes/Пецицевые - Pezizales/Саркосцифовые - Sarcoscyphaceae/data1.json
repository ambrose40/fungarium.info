It is commonly known as the Scarlet elf cup due to its bright red color, which can fade to orange or yellow as the fungus ages. This species is found throughout Europe and North America, where it grows on dead wood, especially that of beech trees.\n\nThe fruiting body of Sarcoscypha austriaca is cup-shaped and can grow up to 5 cm in diameter. It is typically bright red on the outer surface and orange-red on the inner surface, with a distinctive cup-like shape that resembles an elf's cup or goblet. The spores of this fungus are ellipsoidal or spindle-shaped and measure 10-14 x 5-6 µm.\n\nSarcoscypha austriaca is a saprobic fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It is an important decomposer in forest ecosystems, breaking down dead wood and returning nutrients to the soil. The fungus also has a symbiotic relationship with some tree species, including beech and oak, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with the roots of these trees.\n\nThis fungus is widely distributed and can be found in temperate forests around the world. It is most commonly found in Europe and North America, but has also been reported from Asia and Australia. The fruiting body of Sarcoscypha austriaca typically appears in late winter or early spring, usually after a period of mild weather.\n\nSarcoscypha austriaca is not toxic, but it is not considered edible due to its tough and leathery texture. Some cultures use the fungus for medicinal purposes, where it is believed to have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. The Scarlet elf cup is also a popular subject for nature photographers and mushroom enthusiasts due to its striking color and unique shape.\n\nIn conclusion, Sarcoscypha austriaca is a fascinating and important species of fungus. Its bright red color and distinctive shape make it a favorite subject for nature enthusiasts, while its role as a decomposer and mycorrhizal partner make it an important player in forest ecosystems.","dates":{"added":1710623416,"dateRange":{"0":1520961646,"1":1710622707}},"fileDate":"2024-03-16T23:01:50.280Z","category":"folder","title":"Sarcoscypha austriaca - Саркосцифа австрийская - Scarlet elf cup - Rotkelchen oder Österreichische Lorchel."},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B0%20%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Sarcoscypha%20coccinea","deepCounters":{"total":66,"images":66,"files":66},"counters":{"total":66,"images":66,"files":66},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B0%20%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Sarcoscypha%20coccinea\/thumbs\/00fungi-0004489.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Sarcoscypha coccinea - Саркосцифа алая - Scarlet cup - Scharlachroter Kelchbecher<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Sarcoscypha coccinea is a species of cup fungus that belongs to the family Sarcoscyphaceae.

They are characterized by their brightly colored, cup-shaped fruiting bodies and are often found on decaying wood in moist environments.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of fungi in the Sarcoscyphaceae family are typically small to medium-sized, with a diameter ranging from 1 to 10 cm. The inner surface of the cup is smooth and brightly colored, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, while the outer surface is paler and may be hairy or scurfy.\n\nMembers of the Sarcoscyphaceae family are saprotrophic, decomposing dead plant material, particularly wood. They play a crucial role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems by breaking down lignin and cellulose in dead wood.\n\nThese fungi are commonly found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and North America. However, some species can also be found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nThe spores of Sarcoscyphaceae fungi are typically elliptical, smooth, and hyaline, and are formed within asci in the apothecium. They are dispersed by wind or rain splash.\n\nThe most well-known species in this family is Sarcoscypha coccinea, also known as the Scarlet Elf Cup or Scharlachschale in German. This species is characterized by its vibrant red color and is often found on decaying branches in damp forests.\n\nAnother notable species is Sarcoscypha dudleyi, commonly known as the Orange Peel Fungus, which is found in North America and has a bright orange color.\n\nWhile Sarcoscyphaceae fungi are not generally considered edible due to their small size and insubstantial flesh, some species, such as Sarcoscypha coccinea, have been consumed by indigenous peoples in North America.\n\nThese fungi are often used as a natural indicator of the health of a forest ecosystem, as they require a suitable balance of moisture, temperature, and decomposing organic material to thrive.\n\nSarcoscyphaceae fungi are also known to form mycorrhizal associations with certain tree species, providing their host plants with essential nutrients in exchange for sugars.\n\nSome research has suggested that Sarcoscyphaceae fungi may have potential applications in bioremediation and the production of bioactive compounds, though further study is needed to confirm these possibilities.\n\nSpecies within the Sarcoscyphaceae family can be difficult to identify due to their similar appearance and microscopic characteristics, making accurate identification essential for ecological research and conservation efforts.\n\nPreservation of the habitats where these fungi are found is crucial for maintaining their populations and supporting the overall health of forest ecosystems.","dates":{"added":1710623416,"dateRange":{"0":1240090478,"1":1710622707}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.622Z","title":"Sarcoscyphaceae - Саркосцифовые - Scarlet Elf Cups - Scharlachschalen"}
