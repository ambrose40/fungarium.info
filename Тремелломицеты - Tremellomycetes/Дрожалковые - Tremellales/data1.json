The family is cosmopolitan and contains both teleomorphic and anamorphic genera, most of the latter being yeasts. All teleomorphic species of fungi in the Tremellaceae are parasites of other fungi, though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous.\nThe family currently comprises 18 genera (plus synonyms), containing around 250 valid species. Significant genera include Tremella, two species of which are edible and commercially cultivated, and the yeast genus Cryptococcus, several species of which are human pathogens, causing cryptococcosis.","dates":{"added":1664064137,"dateRange":{"0":1255165409,"1":1663838921}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.675Z","category":"folder","title":"Дрожалковые - Tremellaceae"}],"name":"Дрожалковые - Tremellales","comment":"The Tremellales are an order of fungi in the class Tremellomycetes.
