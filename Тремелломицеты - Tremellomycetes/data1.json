The order contains both teleomorphic and anamorphic species, most of the latter being yeasts. All teleomorphic species in the Tremellales are parasites of other fungi, though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous.\nThe order currently comprises 8 families, containing around 300 valid species. Significant genera include Tremella, two species of which are edible and commercially cultivated, and the yeast genera Cryptococcus and Trichosporon, several species of which are human pathogens.","dates":{"added":1713114417,"dateRange":{"0":1255165409,"1":1711892873}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.319Z","category":"folder","title":"Дрожалковые - Tremellales"}],"name":"Тремелломицеты - Tremellomycetes","comment":"The Tremellomycetes are a class of dimorphic fungi.

Tremellomycetes are yeasts, dimorphic taxa, and species that form complex fruiting bodies. Tremellomycetes have 3 orders which can be found in plants, humans, animals. Cystofilobasidiales can be found in plants, Filobasidiella can be found in human bodies and inside insects, and Tremellales can be found on mosses.","dates":{"added":1713114417,"dateRange":{"0":1255165409,"1":1711892873}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.212Z","title":"Тремелломицеты - Tremellomycetes"}
