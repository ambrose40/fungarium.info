This diverse group contains over 17,000 described species, including many well-known mushrooms, such as agarics, boletes, and polypores.\n\nThe hallmark feature of Agaricomycetes is the presence of gills, pores, or other spore-producing structures called hymenophores, which are located on the underside of the fruiting body, or cap.\n\nFruiting bodies of Agaricomycetes are highly diverse, ranging from small, inconspicuous forms to large, striking structures. They can be found in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, and are often used to identify species within the group.\n\nThese fungi can be saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, or parasitic, playing important ecological roles in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant health. Some species form symbiotic relationships with plants, while others cause diseases in trees or crops.\n\nAgaricomycetes inhabit a wide range of environments, from forests and grasslands to urban areas and even arctic tundras. Some species are highly adaptable, while others have specific habitat requirements.\n\nThe spores of Agaricomycetes are produced on the hymenophore structures and are typically dispersed by wind, water, or animal activity. Spore size, shape, and color can be crucial for species identification.\n\nAgaricomycetes can reproduce sexually, through the fusion of compatible mating types, or asexually, through spore production and germination.\n\nSome Agaricomycetes species are highly prized for their culinary and medicinal properties, such as the edible Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) and the medicinal Ganoderma lucidum (reishi mushroom).\n\nOther species, like the deadly Amanita phalloides (death cap), produce potent toxins that can cause severe poisoning or even death if ingested.\n\nAgaricomycetes fungi have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, with modern research uncovering potential applications in cancer treatment, immune system modulation, and neuroprotection.\n\nIn addition to their ecological and medical importance, Agaricomycetes species contribute to the field of biotechnology, with applications in waste management, biofuel production, and the development of novel materials.\n\nSpecies within the Agaricomycetes class can be indicators of ecosystem health, with certain species being sensitive to pollution, habitat degradation, or climate change.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to protect rare or endangered Agaricomycetes species and their habitats, as these fungi play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem balance.","dates":{"added":1709139663,"dateRange":{"0":1190484620,"1":1709038817}},"fileDate":"2024-02-28T18:54:16.302Z","category":"folder","title":"Agaricomycetes - Агарикомицеты - Gilled Fungi - Blätterpilze"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Pezizomycetes","deepCounters":{"total":626,"images":598,"folders":28,"files":598},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Pezizomycetes\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pezizales\/%D0%A1%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Morchellaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Morchella%20elata\/thumbs\/0BO302792.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Pezizomycetes - Пецицомицеты - Cup Fungi - Becherpilze<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Pezizomycetes, commonly known as Cup Fungi or Becherpilze in German, is a class of fungi within the phylum Ascomycota.

This diverse group includes many species known for their distinctive cup-like or disc-shaped fruiting bodies, which give them their common name.\n\nThe class Pezizomycetes contains seven orders, including Pezizales, Helotiales, and Orbiliales, with the Pezizales being the most well-known and containing the largest number of species.\n\nCup Fungi exhibit a wide range of fruiting body morphologies, from simple, shallow cups to more complex, lobed or contorted shapes. The colors of these fungi can also be quite diverse, ranging from bright yellows and oranges to more muted browns and grays.\n\nThese fungi are predominantly saprotrophic, meaning they decompose dead organic matter. Some species also form mycorrhizal associations with plants, providing essential nutrients to their host in exchange for sugars.\n\nPezizomycetes can be found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even arid deserts. Many species are associated with specific substrates, such as decaying wood, leaf litter, or soil.\n\nCup Fungi produce their spores in specialized structures called asci, which are contained within the fruiting body. The spores are often forcibly ejected from the asci and dispersed by wind, water, or animal activity.\n\nThe spores of Pezizomycetes are typically hyaline (translucent), smooth or ornamented, and vary in shape from spherical to elongated.\n\nSome species of Pezizomycetes are prized for their culinary value, such as the morels in the family Morchellaceae and the truffles in the family Tuberaceae.\n\nOther species, such as the Scarlet Elf Cup (Sarcoscypha coccinea), are known for their striking appearance and are sought after by nature photographers and mushroom enthusiasts.\n\nSeveral Pezizomycetes species have been found to produce bioactive compounds with potential applications in medicine, such as antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunosuppressive agents.\n\nSome members of the Pezizomycetes class, like those in the genus Xylaria, are known for their role in the decomposition of wood and their ability to break down complex lignin structures.\n\nSpecies within the Pezizomycetes class can be indicators of environmental health, with certain species being sensitive to pollution and other environmental changes.\n\nThe study of Pezizomycetes contributes to our understanding of fungal diversity and ecology and has implications for conservation efforts, as well as potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.","dates":{"added":1710623416,"dateRange":{"0":1240090478,"1":1710622707}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.209Z","category":"folder","title":"Pezizomycetes - Пецицомицеты - Cup Fungi - Becherpilze"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Leotiomycetes","deepCounters":{"total":421,"images":380,"folders":41,"files":380},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Leotiomycetes\/%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Helotiales\/%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sclerotiniaceae\/%D0%A6%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%8F%20-%20Ciboria%20amentacea\/thumbs\/BO300503-Enhanced.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Леоциомицеты - Leotiomycetes<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Leotiomycetes is a class of fungi within the Ascomycota phylum.

Most have perithecial (flask-shaped) fruiting bodies, but ascomata can be less frequently cleistothecial (like in the genera Anixiella, Apodus, Boothiella, Thielavia, Zopfiella),. Fruiting bodies may be solitary or gregarious, superficial, or immersed within stromata or tissues of the substrates and can be light to bright or black.

The formation of conidia in a fruiting body separates this group from the hyphomycetes, who have \"naked\" conidia.","dates":{"added":1439852901,"dateRange":{"0":1405137822,"1":1439732402}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.205Z","category":"folder","title":"Коеломицеты - Coelomycetes"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Lecanoromycetes","deepCounters":{"total":21,"images":18,"folders":3,"files":18},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Lecanoromycetes\/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lecanorales\/%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Biatorellaceae\/%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B0%20%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%85%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%2C%20%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%20-%20Biatorella%20difformis\/thumbs\/DSC04068.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Леканоромицеты - Lecanoromycetes<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Lecanoromycetes is the largest class of lichenized fungi.
