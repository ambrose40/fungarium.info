This mushroom is characterized by its shelf-like, elongated fruiting bodies, which are typically 3-12 cm wide, 2-6 cm deep, and up to 2 cm thick.\n\nThe upper surface of the fruiting body is covered in a reddish-brown to dark brown crust with fine radial wrinkles, while the margin is often paler and slightly wavy.\n\nThe underside of the fruiting body features gills that are rusty brown in color, running down the length of the cap. These gills are irregularly spaced and forked, giving the mushroom its common name.\n\nThe flesh of the Rusty Gilled Polypore is thin, leathery, and fibrous, with a light brown color and a slightly sweet smell.\n\nGloeophyllum sepiarium is a saprobic fungus, meaning it feeds on dead organic matter. It primarily colonizes coniferous wood, such as pine and spruce, causing a brown rot.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of G. sepiarium can be found year-round, with a peak in late summer to autumn.\n\nThis species has a wide distribution and is commonly found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\nThe spores of Gloeophyllum sepiarium are cylindrical to allantoid (sausage-shaped), measuring 6-9 x 2.5-3.5 micrometers.\n\nGloeophyllum sepiarium is inedible due to its tough and leathery texture.\n\nThis fungus plays an essential ecological role in breaking down deadwood in forest ecosystems.\n\nGloeophyllum sepiarium is related to other species within the Gloeophyllum genus, such as Gloeophyllum abietinum and Gloeophyllum trabeum, which also cause brown rot on coniferous wood.\n\nThe Rusty Gilled Polypore is known for its ability to produce extracellular enzymes that can break down lignocellulose, a major component of plant cell walls.","dates":{"added":1628972910,"dateRange":{"0":1226254391,"1":1604242006}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:20.179Z","category":"folder","title":"Gloeophyllum sepiarium - Глеофиллум заборный - Rusty Gilled Polypore - Rostblättriger Zaunblättling"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Neolentinus%20cyathiformis","deepCounters":{"total":21,"images":21,"files":21},"counters":{"total":21,"images":21,"files":21},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Neolentinus%20cyathiformis\/thumbs\/SET08692.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Neolentinus cyathiformis - Пилолистник бокаловидный - Goblet-shaped Neolentinus - Kelchförmiger Neolentinus<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Neolentinus cyathiformis, or the Goblet-shaped Neolentinus, is a rare and unique mushroom species belonging to the family Gloeophyllaceae.
