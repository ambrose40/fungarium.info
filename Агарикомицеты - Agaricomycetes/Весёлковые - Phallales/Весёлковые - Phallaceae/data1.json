Stinkhorns have a worldwide distribution, but are especially prevalent in tropical regions. They are known for their foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, borne on the end of a stalk called the receptaculum. The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies, beetles and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although there is great diversity in body structure shape among the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as \"eggs\". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species.","dates":{"added":1599674707,"dateRange":{"0":1304858977,"1":1599141996}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.431Z","title":"Весёлковые - Phallaceae"}
