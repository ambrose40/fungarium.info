This order is one of the largest and most diverse groups of fungi, with over 13,000 described species.\n\nThe fruiting body of Agaricales is typically a mushroom or toadstool, which is composed of a stalk, cap, and gills on the underside of the cap. These structures are used to release spores, which are typically dispersed by wind or rain. The spores of Agaricales are produced in basidia, which are elongated cells that contain four spores each.\n\nAgaricales fungi have a wide range of lifestyles, including saprobic, mycorrhizal, and parasitic. Some species are important decomposers in forest ecosystems, breaking down dead wood and returning nutrients to the soil. Others form mutualistic relationships with the roots of trees, exchanging nutrients for carbon in a process known as mycorrhizal symbiosis. Some species are also pathogenic, infecting living trees and causing damage to the host plant.\n\nThis order includes many highly prized edible and medicinal fungi, including species in the genera Agaricus, Lepiota, and Pleurotus. Some of these fungi are also used in traditional medicine, where they are believed to have anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumor properties.\n\nAgaricales fungi are widely distributed and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are most commonly found in temperate regions, but can also be found in tropical and arctic regions.\n\nIn conclusion, Agaricales is a diverse and important order of fungi. Its members include some of the most prized edible and medicinal fungi, as well as important decomposers and mycorrhizal partners in forest ecosystems. The wide range of lifestyles and habitats of these fungi make them an important and fascinating group for scientific study.","dates":{"added":1703524415,"dateRange":{"0":1190484620,"1":1703071611}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.225Z","category":"folder","title":"Agaricomycetes - Агарикомицеты - Gilled Fungi - Blätterpilze"},{"path":"%D0%90%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Auriculariales","deepCounters":{"total":56,"images":49,"folders":7,"files":49},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%90%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Auriculariales\/%D0%90%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Auriculariaceae\/%D0%90%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Auricularia%20auricula-judae\/thumbs\/fungi-0004399.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Аурикуляриевые - Auriculariales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Auriculariales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes.

This order includes fungi characterized by their ability to cause brown rot on wood, making them crucial players in forest ecosystems as decomposers of dead plant material.\n\nThe Gloeophyllales order contains two families: Gloeophyllaceae and Meruliaceae. The Gloeophyllaceae family is the more well-known of the two, containing several species of fungi that decompose coniferous wood.\n\nFungi within the Gloeophyllales order are known for their production of extracellular enzymes, which help break down complex plant materials like lignocellulose.\n\nGloeophyllales fungi are typically found in forests and wooded areas where there is a constant source of deadwood for them to consume.\n\nThese fungi are widespread, being found in various regions around the world, including Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\nSome common species within the Gloeophyllaceae family include Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Rusty Gilled Polypore), Gloeophyllum abietinum, and Gloeophyllum trabeum.\n\nWhile some species have unique features, they generally have a similar appearance, with brownish, tough, and leathery fruiting bodies.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of these fungi are typically in the form of brackets or crusts that grow on decaying wood.\n\nFungi within the Gloeophyllales order are not considered edible due to their tough, leathery texture, and potential toxicity.\n\nThe spores of these fungi are usually cylindrical to allantoid (sausage-shaped) and are produced in basidia within the fruiting body.\n\nGloeophyllales species are not typically used for medicinal or culinary purposes, although research into their enzyme production could lead to potential industrial applications.\n\nGloeophyllales fungi help recycle nutrients within forest ecosystems by breaking down complex plant materials and returning them to the soil.\n\nDue to their ecological importance, conservation efforts should focus on preserving natural habitats where these fungi thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the Gloeophyllales order contains essential decomposers in forest ecosystems, characterized by their brown rot-causing abilities and the production of extracellular enzymes. While not edible, these fungi have the potential for industrial applications due to their unique enzymatic properties.\n\nAs a whole, Gloeophyllales fungi play a significant role in maintaining the health and balance of forest ecosystems, making them an essential component of the natural world.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1226254391,"1":1683111766}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.229Z","category":"folder","title":"Gloeophyllales - Глеофилловые - Gloeophyllales - Gloeophyllales"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphales","deepCounters":{"total":55,"images":48,"folders":7,"files":48},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphales\/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphaceae\/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20stricta\/thumbs\/0DSC00595.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гомфовые - Gomphales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Gomphales are an order of basidiomycete fungi.

The Sphaerobolus are known as \"shotgun fungus\" or \"cannonball fungus\". They colonize wood-based mulches and may throw black, sticky, spore-containing globs onto nearby surfaces.\nThe fruiting bodies of several earthstars are hygroscopic: in dry weather the \"petals\" will dry and curl up around the soft spore sac, protecting it. In this state, often the whole fungus becomes detached from the ground and may roll around like a tumbleweed. Once mature, their exoperidium splits into a variable number of rays, which give Geastrum their visible star shape. The exoperidial rays are there to protect the endoperidial body and orchestrate spore dispersal. In wetter weather, the \"petals\" moisten and uncurl; some even curl backward lifting the spore sac up. This allows rain or animals to hit the spore sac so, emitting spores when enough moisture is present for them to germinate and establish.","dates":{"added":1471899627,"dateRange":{"0":1250863945,"1":1471687103}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.230Z","category":"folder","title":"Звездовиковые - Geastrales"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Corticiales","deepCounters":{"total":14,"images":11,"folders":3,"files":11},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Corticiales\/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Corticiaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC%20%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Laeticorticium%20roseum\/thumbs\/DSC09575.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Кортициевые - Corticiales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Corticiales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes.

This diverse group contains over 17,000 described species, including many well-known mushrooms, such as agarics, boletes, and polypores.\n\nThe hallmark feature of Agaricomycetes is the presence of gills, pores, or other spore-producing structures called hymenophores, which are located on the underside of the fruiting body, or cap.\n\nFruiting bodies of Agaricomycetes are highly diverse, ranging from small, inconspicuous forms to large, striking structures. They can be found in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, and are often used to identify species within the group.\n\nThese fungi can be saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, or parasitic, playing important ecological roles in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant health. Some species form symbiotic relationships with plants, while others cause diseases in trees or crops.\n\nAgaricomycetes inhabit a wide range of environments, from forests and grasslands to urban areas and even arctic tundras. Some species are highly adaptable, while others have specific habitat requirements.\n\nThe spores of Agaricomycetes are produced on the hymenophore structures and are typically dispersed by wind, water, or animal activity. Spore size, shape, and color can be crucial for species identification.\n\nAgaricomycetes can reproduce sexually, through the fusion of compatible mating types, or asexually, through spore production and germination.\n\nSome Agaricomycetes species are highly prized for their culinary and medicinal properties, such as the edible Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) and the medicinal Ganoderma lucidum (reishi mushroom).\n\nOther species, like the deadly Amanita phalloides (death cap), produce potent toxins that can cause severe poisoning or even death if ingested.\n\nAgaricomycetes fungi have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, with modern research uncovering potential applications in cancer treatment, immune system modulation, and neuroprotection.\n\nIn addition to their ecological and medical importance, Agaricomycetes species contribute to the field of biotechnology, with applications in waste management, biofuel production, and the development of novel materials.\n\nSpecies within the Agaricomycetes class can be indicators of ecosystem health, with certain species being sensitive to pollution, habitat degradation, or climate change.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to protect rare or endangered Agaricomycetes species and their habitats, as these fungi play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem balance.","dates":{"added":1703524415,"dateRange":{"0":1190484620,"1":1703072220}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.203Z","title":"Agaricomycetes - Агарикомицеты - Gilled Fungi - Blätterpilze"}
