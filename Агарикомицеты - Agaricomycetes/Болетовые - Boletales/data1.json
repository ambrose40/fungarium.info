Nearly as widely distributed as the agarics, the family is renowned for hosting some prime edible species highly sought after by mushroom hunters worldwide, such as the cep or king bolete (Boletus edulis). A number of rare or threatened species are also present in the family, that have become the focus of increasing conservation concerns. As a whole, the typical members of the family are commonly known as boletes.\nBoletes are a reasonably safe group of mushrooms for human consumption, as none of them are known to be deadly to adults. Edible bolete species are especially suitable for novice collectors, since they pose little danger of being confused with deadly poisonous mushrooms, such as deadly Amanita species which bear gills instead of pores in their hymenial surface. Some boletes are toxic and may cause gastrointestinal poisoning if consumed, but these are unlikely to be confused with popular edible species in the family.\nThe family has been the subject of extensive systematic revisions in recent years, as some of the early established genera (particularly Boletus, Leccinum and Xerocomus), have revealed to be highly polyphyletic, and the original number of genera within the family had been underestimated. As a result, several new species and genera have been described from Asia, Europe and North America, while many existing species have been transferred to different genera, in concordance with phylogenetic results.","dates":{"added":1668208444,"dateRange":{"0":1190487440,"1":1667743618}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.420Z","category":"folder","title":"Болетовые - Boletaceae"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Hygrophoropsidaceae","deepCounters":{"total":51,"images":50,"folders":1,"files":50},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Hygrophoropsidaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Hygrophoropsis%20aurantiaca\/thumbs\/00DSC05832.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гигрофоропсисовые - Hygrophoropsidaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Hygrophoropsidaceae are a family of mushrooms that are gilled in appearance but lie within the Boletales.

Unlike other boletes, all members of Gomphidiaceae (except for Gomphogaster) are agarics, having gills instead of pores. Member genera include Chroogomphus, Cystogomphus, Gomphidius and Gomphogaster, the last being a monotypic genus (i.e. with a single species) that may be incorporated into Gomphidius in the future after molecular assessment. The similarly named genus Gomphus is unrelated to this family. Another genus Brauniellula has since been sunk into Chroogomphus.\nLike all agarics, this group was formerly classified in Agaricales. Nonetheless, many of the microscopic features of these fungi, such as spore shape, strongly suggested an affinity with Boletales. This was later confirmed through molecular phylogenetic investigation, which demonstrated that Gomphidiaceae are more closely related to boletes than the \"true\" agarics of the Agaricales and that the development of gills in this group was an independent evolutionary event from the development of gills in the Agaricales. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have also demonstrated Gomphidiaceae are nested well within Boletales, being more closely related to Suillaceae than to Boletaceae, a finding that is supported by chemotaxonomic investigation of these groups.\nThis family of fungi has been thought to be ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationship with their host trees, however, there is now evidence that many (and perhaps all) species in this group are parasitic upon ectomycorrhizal boletes, in relationships that are often highly species-specific.","dates":{"added":1664064137,"dateRange":{"0":1313843311,"1":1663678860}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.425Z","category":"folder","title":"Мокруховые - Gomphidiaceae"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rhizopogonaceae","deepCounters":{"total":26,"images":24,"folders":2,"files":24},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rhizopogonaceae\/%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20vulgaris\/thumbs\/DSC01621.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Ризопогоновые - Rhizopogonaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Rhizopogonaceae are a family of fungi in the order Boletales.
