This species is characterized by its small, conical to bell-shaped, brownish-yellow cap that can become more flat with age, and by its fibrous, silky surface that gives it a shiny appearance. It has a slender, fibrillose stem, typically 3-6 cm in length, that is slightly enlarged at the base. The gills are adnexed to the stem and are initially pale, becoming rusty-brown as the spores mature.\n\nAdvanced scientific research on Inocybe nitidiuscula has revealed that it contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including indole alkaloids and tryptamines, which may have potential medicinal applications. The fungus is primarily found in Europe and North America, particularly in deciduous and mixed forests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with various tree species such as oak and beech. It typically grows in soil, often at the base of trees, and can be found from late spring to autumn.\n\nThe spores of Inocybe nitidiuscula are smooth, elliptical, and measure around 7-10 x 4-6 µm. It produces a large number of spores, with a single mature fruiting body capable of releasing millions of them. These spores are spread by the wind, allowing the fungus to colonize new areas. As with other Inocybe species, Inocybe nitidiuscula is considered inedible and potentially toxic, with consumption potentially causing gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms. It is important to exercise caution when foraging for mushrooms, as misidentification can lead to serious health consequences.","dates":{"added":1664064137,"dateRange":{"0":1663757903,"1":1663757983}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:06.470Z","category":"folder","title":"Inocybe nitidiuscula - Волоконница блестящая - Shiny Fibrecap - Glänzender Faserling"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20fuscidula","deepCounters":{"total":23,"images":23,"files":23},"counters":{"total":23,"images":23,"files":23},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20fuscidula\/thumbs\/tohisoo_manor_park_area-1.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Волоконница буроватая - Inocybe fuscidula<\/h3>","name":"Волоконница буроватая - Inocybe fuscidula","dates":{"added":1690504203,"dateRange":{"0":1690459506,"1":1690460348}},"fileDate":"2023-07-28T03:30:03.580Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20dulcamara","deepCounters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"counters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20dulcamara\/thumbs\/0DSC06836.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Inocybe dulcamara - Волоконница горько-сладкая - Bittersweet Fibrecap - Bittersüßer Faserling<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Inocybe dulcamara, also known as the Bittersweet Fibrecap or Bittersüßer Faserling, is a medium-sized, mycorrhizal basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Волоконница горько-сладкая - Inocybe dulcamara","comment":"Inocybe dulcamara, also known as the Bittersweet Fibrecap or Bittersüßer Faserling, is a medium-sized, mycorrhizal basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the Inocybaceae family.

Many species in this family are characterized by their fibrous or silky cap surface and the presence of a cortina, a cobweb-like veil that covers the gills when young.\n\nMembers of the Inocybaceae family are predominantly mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with various plants, especially trees. These fungi help their host plants by providing essential nutrients in exchange for carbohydrates, and they play a vital role in forest ecosystems.\n\nThe Inocybaceae family is widely distributed across North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Russia. They can be found in a range of habitats, including deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as grasslands and meadows.\n\nSpore morphology within the Inocybaceae family is diverse, with some species producing smooth, elliptical spores, while others have ornamented or nodulose spores. Spore sizes can vary, generally measuring between 6-12 µm in length and 4-8 µm in width. The spore print color also varies, ranging from pale yellowish-brown to rusty brown.\n\nThe number of spores produced per fruiting body depends on the species and environmental conditions, but generally, millions of spores can be produced by a single mushroom. Many species in the Inocybaceae family are considered difficult to identify due to their similar macroscopic features, and microscopic examination is often required for accurate identification.\n\nSome species within the Inocybaceae family are considered edible, while others are toxic and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms if ingested. Proper identification is essential when foraging for mushrooms to avoid accidental ingestion of harmful species.\n\nIn German, the Inocybaceae family is known as the Inocybaceae Familie, which reflects the close relationship between the various species within this group. The Inocybaceae family is an area of active research, with scientists working to better understand the ecological roles, phylogenetics, and taxonomy of the species within this diverse group of fungi.","dates":{"added":1690504203,"dateRange":{"0":1630158203,"1":1690460348}},"fileDate":"2023-07-28T03:22:17.626Z","title":"Inocybaceae - Волоконницевые - Inocybaceae Family - Inocybaceae Familie"}
