The white to pinkish-grey stem, which may grow up to 15 cm tall, features a distinct ring and a bulbous base with a membranous, sack-like volva.\n\nAdvanced scientific research has shown that Amanita rubescens contains a hemolytic toxin called rubescentin, which breaks down red blood cells. However, cooking the Blusher can effectively destroy this toxin, making the mushroom edible when properly prepared.\n\nThe Blusher is widely distributed across Europe and parts of North America, including parts of Russia, where it is known as Мухомор серо-розовый. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with various tree species, particularly deciduous trees like oaks, beeches, and birches, and is typically encountered during late summer and autumn.\n\nAmanita rubescens produces white, elliptical spores that measure approximately 8-10 µm by 6-7 µm. The spore print is also white, making it a key characteristic for identification. An estimated 1-2 million spores are produced per fruiting body, which are dispersed by wind and rain.\n\nAlthough Amanita rubescens is considered edible when cooked, it is crucial to exercise caution when foraging, as the Blusher can be easily confused with other toxic Amanita species. Ingestion of raw or undercooked Amanita rubescens may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and, in rare cases, hemolysis.\n\nIn German, this fungus is known as Perlpilz, a name that reflects its pinkish hue and its close relationship with the Amanita genus.","dates":{"added":1630785202,"dateRange":{"0":1348308028,"1":1569667903}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:01.880Z","category":"folder","title":"Amanita rubescens - Мухомор серо-розовый - Blusher - Perlpilz"},{"path":"%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%20%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B6%D1%91%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Amanita%20gemmata","deepCounters":{"total":5,"images":5,"files":5},"counters":{"total":5,"images":5,"files":5},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%20%D1%8F%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B6%D1%91%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Amanita%20gemmata\/thumbs\/DSC01846.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Amanita gemmata - Мухомор ярко-жёлтый - Gemmed Amanita - Gelber Knollenblätterpilz<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Amanita gemmata, commonly known as the Gemmed Amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus belonging to the Amanita genus.

This family is characterized by their distinctive fruiting body, which typically includes a cap, stalk, and skirt-like annulus.\n\nThe fruiting body of Amanitaceae is typically large and showy, with a cap that can range from white to yellow, brown, or red. The cap is often covered in warts or scales, which can be used to help identify different species. The spores of Amanitaceae are produced in basidia, which are elongated cells that contain four spores each.\n\nAmanitaceae fungi are mycorrhizal, meaning they form mutualistic relationships with the roots of trees. They exchange nutrients for carbon in a process that benefits both the fungus and the host plant. Some species are also toxic, producing potent toxins that can cause severe illness or death if ingested.\n\nThis family includes many highly toxic species, including Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the Death cap, and Amanita virosa, the Destroying angel. These fungi are responsible for the majority of mushroom poisonings worldwide and should never be consumed. Some species of Amanitaceae are also used in traditional medicine, where they are believed to have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.\n\nAmanitaceae fungi are widely distributed and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are most commonly found in temperate regions, but can also be found in tropical and arctic regions.\n\nIn conclusion, Amanitaceae is a fascinating and important family of fungi. Its members include some of the most toxic and deadly fungi in the world, as well as important mycorrhizal partners in forest ecosystems. The distinctive morphologies and lifestyles of these fungi make them an important and fascinating group for scientific study.","dates":{"added":1664725500,"dateRange":{"0":1190484620,"1":1664635756}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.339Z","title":"Amanitaceae - Аманитовые - Amanita family - Wulstlingsverwandte"}
