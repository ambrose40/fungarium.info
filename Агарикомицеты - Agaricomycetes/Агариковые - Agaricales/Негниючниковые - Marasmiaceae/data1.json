The spore print is white, adding another identification feature.\n\nMarasmius oreades is a saprobic fungus, deriving nutrients from decaying organic matter. It grows in grasslands and pastures, often forming fairy rings which are circular patterns of mushrooms that can sometimes reach many meters in diameter.\n\nThe Scotch Bonnet is widely distributed across North America, Europe, and Asia, and can typically be found from late spring to autumn.\n\nChemically, Marasmius oreades contains compounds that give it a pleasant, nutty aroma. Despite its small size, it is quite flavorful, making it a favorite among foragers.\n\nThe fruit bodies of Marasmius oreades are used in various culinary applications. They can be used fresh in salads and stir-fries or can be dried for later use. The drying process enhances their flavor, and they can be rehydrated quickly due to their thin flesh.\n\nThere are no known medicinal properties of Marasmius oreades, but like many mushrooms, they contain beneficial nutrients such as dietary fiber and vitamins.\n\nCaution should be taken when identifying this mushroom for consumption, as it can resemble some toxic species. Always remember to properly identify any foraged mushrooms before eating.\n\nIn summary, Marasmius oreades is a small but flavorful mushroom that is valued for its culinary uses. It's an integral part of the ecosystem, helping to break down organic matter in grassy habitats.","dates":{"added":1690504203,"dateRange":{"0":1688658719,"1":1690461129}},"fileDate":"2023-07-28T02:10:36.580Z","category":"folder","title":"Marasmius oreades - Негниючник луговой - Scotch Bonnet - Masshroom"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Rhodocollybia%20butyracea","deepCounters":{"total":3,"images":3,"files":3},"counters":{"total":3,"images":3,"files":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Rhodocollybia%20butyracea\/thumbs\/DSC06788.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Rhodocollybia butyracea - Родоколлибия масляная - Buttercap - Butterpilz<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Rhodocollybia butyracea, also known as the buttercap, is a small agaricomycete fungus that is commonly found in temperate forests around the world.

They are characterized by their small to medium-sized fruiting bodies, consisting of a cap, stem, and gills, which are often tough and leathery.\n\nMembers of this family are commonly known as \"marasmioid mushrooms\" due to their distinct fruiting body features, which are resistant to decay and can revive after drying.\n\nMarasmiaceae fungi can be found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and other terrestrial environments. They are primarily decomposers of plant material such as leaves, twigs, and wood, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.\n\nThe family has a worldwide distribution, with species found in North America, Europe, Asia, and other regions.\n\nMarasmiaceae contains several genera, including Marasmius, Gymnopus, and Crinipellis, which together encompass hundreds of species.\n\nMarasmius, the type genus of the family, is well-known for its species Marasmius oreades, commonly called the \"fairy ring mushroom,\" due to the circular patterns it forms in grassy areas.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Marasmiaceae fungi exhibit a wide range of colors, such as white, brown, gray, or red, with some species having distinct color patterns.\n\nSpore prints of Marasmiaceae fungi are typically white, pale cream, or yellowish, and their spores are smooth, ellipsoid, or elongated.\n\nMarasmiaceae fungi often possess a cartilaginous or tough texture, which enables them to withstand desiccation and revive upon rehydration.\n\nMany Marasmiaceae species have a unique odor, ranging from sweet and fruity to more unpleasant and rank. However, some species may have little to no discernible odor.\n\nThe edibility of Marasmiaceae fungi varies, with some species being edible, such as Marasmius oreades, while others are inedible or of unknown edibility. Consuming unidentified mushrooms can pose a risk, and caution is advised.\n\nSome Marasmiaceae fungi have been reported to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, or cytotoxic properties, which may hold potential for future research in medicine or other fields.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have significantly impacted the classification of Marasmiaceae, revealing new relationships between species and genera.\n\nAccurate identification of Marasmiaceae fungi often requires microscopic analysis of spore morphology, gill attachment, and other features, as well as macroscopic observations of color, size, and habitat.","dates":{"added":1690504203,"dateRange":{"0":1301657762,"1":1690461129}},"fileDate":"2023-07-08T02:01:39.806Z","title":"Marasmiaceae - Негниючниковые - Marasmioid mushrooms - Schwindlingsverwandte"}
