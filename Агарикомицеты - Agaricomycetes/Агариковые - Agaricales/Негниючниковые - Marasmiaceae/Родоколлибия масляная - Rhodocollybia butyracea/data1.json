This mushroom is saprobic, meaning that it obtains its nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter, such as leaf litter and rotting wood.\n\nThe cap of R. butyracea ranges from 2-8cm in diameter and is convex or flattened with a wavy margin. Its stem is usually about 2-8cm long and is tough and fibrous. The gills are crowded and whitish to pale yellow. The spores of R. butyracea are elliptical and smooth, typically measuring 6-7µm in length.\n\nChemically, R. butyracea contains a number of bioactive compounds, including ergosterol, which is a precursor to vitamin D. Additionally, some studies have shown that this fungus has antibacterial and antifungal properties.\n\nR. butyracea is often found growing on the forest floor, and can be found in a variety of habitats, including deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as grasslands and gardens. It is distributed worldwide, and can be found throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\nIn addition to its ecological importance as a decomposer, R. butyracea has also been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It has been used to treat a variety of ailments, including stomach disorders and skin infections.\n\nInterestingly, recent research has suggested that R. butyracea may have potential as a source of natural food flavorings. The mushroom has a distinctive buttery flavor, and may be a potential alternative to synthetic flavorings.\n\nOverall, Rhodocollybia butyracea is an interesting and important fungus with a wide range of potential uses in scientific research, traditional medicine, and the food industry.","dates":{"added":1633205755,"dateRange":{"0":1633172224,"1":1633172257}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:34.307Z","title":"Rhodocollybia butyracea - Родоколлибия масляная - Buttercap - Butterpilz"}
