This fungus is characterized by its distinctive white, fan- or shell-shaped caps, which can measure 1-3 cm in width.\n\nThe cap surface is typically smooth, with a slightly wavy margin, and the color may sometimes have a pale grayish or ivory hue. The gills of C. candidissimum are white, decurrent, and closely spaced, running down the short, eccentric stem.\n\nThe stem of this mushroom is usually 0.5-1.5 cm long and 1-3 mm thick, with a white, smooth, and somewhat fragile appearance. The spore print is white, with ellipsoid, smooth, and non-amyloid spores measuring 4-6 x 2-3 µm.\n\nCheimonophyllum candidissimum is a saprotrophic fungus, obtaining nutrients by decomposing dead organic material. It is commonly found growing on decaying wood, particularly hardwoods, and sometimes on bark or other plant debris.\n\nThe distribution of C. candidissimum is predominantly in North America and Europe, although it has also been reported in other regions. It is most commonly found in temperate and boreal forests, particularly in areas with abundant decaying wood.\n\nThe fruiting period of this fungus typically occurs from late summer to autumn, depending on the local climate and weather conditions.\n\nAlthough C. candidissimum is not considered a popular edible mushroom due to its small size and fragility, it is not known to be toxic. Nonetheless, it is generally not recommended for consumption.\n\nOne of the interesting features of this species is its ability to produce bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols and terpenes, which have shown potential antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in some studies.\n\nThere is still much to learn about the ecology and biology of Cheimonophyllum candidissimum, as it is a relatively understudied species.","dates":{"added":1631723361,"dateRange":{"0":1301657696,"1":1679595354}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:51:15.421Z","title":"Cheimonophyllum candidissimum - Хеймонофиллум белейший - White Oysterette - Weißer Austernpilzähnlicher"}
