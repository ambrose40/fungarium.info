This family belongs to the order Agaricales and encompasses over 1,500 species across several genera, with Entoloma being the most prominent and species-rich genus.\n\nThese mushrooms exhibit a wide variety of morphological features, including different cap shapes, colors, and sizes. However, the presence of pinkish spores and angular edges in the spore print is a unifying characteristic of the family.\n\nEntolomataceae fungi can be found throughout the world, with species inhabiting various ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and even arctic tundra. They typically grow on the ground, although some species can be found growing on decaying wood.\n\nThe majority of Entolomataceae species are saprobic, meaning they play a crucial role in the decomposition of organic matter, particularly plant material. Some species are also ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of specific host plants, while others are parasitic on other fungi.\n\nMembers of the Entolomataceae family display a range of edibility. Some species are edible, while others are toxic or cause gastrointestinal distress. For instance, Entoloma sinuatum, commonly known as the Livid Pinkgill, is poisonous and can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms if ingested.\n\nThe spores of Entolomataceae are typically pink, with a size range of 7-15 x 5-8 micrometers, depending on the species. The spores are produced in basidia, which are then released into the environment to aid in reproduction and dispersal.\n\nThe Entolomataceae family is of interest to researchers due to its diverse chemical composition. Some species contain bioactive compounds with potential medicinal properties, while others produce toxins that can cause adverse reactions if consumed.\n\nOne species in the family, Entoloma abortivum, is known for its unique parasitic relationship with another fungus, Armillaria mellea. This interaction results in the formation of an \"aborted\" fruiting body, giving it the common name of \"Aborted Entoloma.\"\n\nThe taxonomy of the Entolomataceae family is complex, with numerous revisions and reclassifications over the years. DNA-based phylogenetic studies have provided a better understanding of the relationships between different genera, but many questions remain.\n\nDue to their diverse morphology, Entolomataceae species can be difficult to identify without the aid of a microscope. The pink spore print and angular spores are key features to look for when identifying members of this family.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1497167761,"1":1683108874}},"fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:44:09.800Z","title":"Entolomataceae - Энтоломовые - Pinkgill Family - Rötlinge"}
