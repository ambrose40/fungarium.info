This family comprises several genera, including Stropharia, Hypholoma, Pholiota, and others.\n\nMembers of the Strophariaceae family are characterized by their fleshy fruiting bodies with varying cap shapes, sizes, and colors. The caps usually have a slimy or sticky surface, and the gills underneath are often attached to the stem.\n\nThe spores of Strophariaceae fungi are generally brown to dark brown in color, and they produce a dark spore print. The fruiting bodies often feature a partial veil, which can leave a ring on the stem as the mushroom matures.\n\nThese fungi are found in a wide range of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and decaying organic matter. They can be saprotrophic, decomposing dead plant material, or mycorrhizal, forming mutually beneficial relationships with the roots of living plants.\n\nThe distribution of Strophariaceae mushrooms is global, and they can be found across temperate and tropical regions, with some species more common in certain areas than others.\n\nSome species within the Strophariaceae family are edible, such as Stropharia rugosoannulata, also known as the Wine Cap or King Stropharia. However, there are also toxic species in this family, like Hypholoma fasciculare, commonly known as the Sulphur Tuft.\n\nThe edibility of Strophariaceae mushrooms can vary greatly, so proper identification is crucial before consumption. It is essential to consult expert sources and be confident in identifying the species in question.\n\nMany species in this family have been studied for their potential medicinal properties, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities, although more research is needed to confirm these benefits.\n\nStrophariaceae fungi play important ecological roles in nutrient cycling, breaking down organic matter, and contributing to soil fertility.\n\nThe study of Strophariaceae mushrooms can help scientists better understand fungal diversity, ecology, and evolution, as well as potential applications in medicine and biotechnology.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have led to taxonomic revisions within the Strophariaceae family, resulting in a more accurate classification of its members based on genetic relationships.","dates":{"added":1690504203,"dateRange":{"0":1254145448,"1":1690496054}},"fileDate":"2023-07-28T03:27:13.211Z","title":"Strophariaceae - Строфариевые - Stropharia family - Träuschlingsverwandten"}
