   		<description>Armillaria cepistipes, commonly known as the Bulbous Honey Mushroom or Zwiebelstieliger Hallimasch in German, is a medium-sized mushroom species belonging to the Physalacriaceae family. The cap of this fungus measures 3 to 10 cm in diameter, with a convex to flat shape and a smooth surface. The cap color ranges from honey-yellow to brownish, often with a slightly darker center.

The gills of Armillaria cepistipes are adnate to slightly decurrent (running down the stem) and white to cream in color. The stem is 5-15 cm tall and 0.5-2 cm thick, with a white to yellowish color and a bulbous base, giving the species its common name.

Armillaria cepistipes can be found across Europe and North America, primarily in deciduous and mixed forests. It grows in clusters around the bases of living or dead trees, particularly on hardwoods, from late summer to late autumn.

The chemistry of Armillaria cepistipes is not well studied, but it is considered an edible mushroom when cooked, although it is less popular than its close relative, Armillaria mellea.

The spores of Armillaria cepistipes are white, elliptical, and measure 7-10 x 5-6 micrometers. They are produced in basidia and are released into the environment for reproduction and dispersal.

Armillaria cepistipes is not only notable for its edibility but also for its role as a plant pathogen. It can cause root rot in various tree species, leading to decline and death. However, its pathogenicity is considered to be less aggressive than that of Armillaria mellea.

The fungus is known for its mycelial structures called rhizomorphs, which resemble black shoelaces and allow the fungus to spread underground and infect trees.</description>
