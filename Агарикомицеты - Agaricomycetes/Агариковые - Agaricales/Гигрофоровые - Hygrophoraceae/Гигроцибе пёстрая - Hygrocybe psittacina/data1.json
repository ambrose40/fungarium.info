It is characterized by a convex to broadly convex cap, measuring 1-4 cm in diameter, with a smooth, slightly slimy surface and a color that ranges from green to greenish-yellow, sometimes with red or orange hues. The stem is slender, measuring 2-5 cm long and 0.2-0.6 cm thick, with a yellowish to greenish color and a smooth texture. The gills are narrowly spaced, adnate to adnexed, and yellow to greenish-yellow in color.\n\nHygrocybe psittacina is known for its striking coloration, resembling the vibrant plumage of a parrot, which sets it apart from other Hygrocybe species. This fungus is primarily distributed across Europe and North America, where it can be found in grasslands, meadows, and pastures, particularly in areas with low nutrient levels and little disturbance. It prefers moist, acidic soil and can be encountered from late spring to late autumn.\n\nThe spores of Hygrocybe psittacina are smooth, ellipsoidal, and measure approximately 7-9 x 4-5 µm. It produces a large number of spores, with a single mature fruiting body capable of releasing millions of them. These spores are dispersed by the wind, allowing the fungus to colonize new areas. Hygrocybe psittacina is considered edible, although it is not highly valued as a culinary ingredient due to its mild taste and slimy texture. Mushroom foragers should exercise caution when collecting mushrooms to avoid misidentification and accidental consumption of toxic species.","dates":{"added":1433107698,"dateRange":{"0":1679248189,"1":1679248189}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:10.501Z","title":"Hygrocybe psittacina - Гигроцибе пёстрая - Parrot Waxcap - Papagei-Saftling"}
