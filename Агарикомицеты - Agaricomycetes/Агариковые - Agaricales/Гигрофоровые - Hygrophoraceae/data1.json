Mushroom foragers should exercise caution when collecting mushrooms to avoid misidentification and accidental consumption of toxic species.","dates":{"added":1664725500,"dateRange":{"0":1663595966,"1":1664630872}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:11.497Z","category":"folder","title":"Cantharellula umbonata - Кантареллула бугорковая - Umbonate Chanterelle - Höckeriger Scheinpfifferling"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Cuphophyllus%20virgineus","deepCounters":{"total":7,"images":7,"files":7},"counters":{"total":7,"images":7,"files":7},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Cuphophyllus%20virgineus\/thumbs\/DSC00509.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Cuphophyllus virgineus - Куфофиллус девичий - Snowy Waxcap - Weißer Saftling<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Cuphophyllus virgineus, commonly known as the Snowy Waxcap or Weißer Saftling, is a small to medium-sized basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the family&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Куфофиллус девичий - Cuphophyllus virgineus","comment":"Cuphophyllus virgineus, commonly known as the Snowy Waxcap or Weißer Saftling, is a small to medium-sized basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the family Hygrophoraceae. It is characterized by a convex to broadly convex cap, measuring 2-6 cm in diameter, with a smooth, slightly slimy surface and a pure white color. The stem is slender, measuring 3-6 cm long and 0.3-1 cm thick, with a white color and a smooth texture. The gills are narrowly spaced, adnate to adnexed, and white in color.\n\nCuphophyllus virgineus is known for its pure white coloration, which sets it apart from other waxcap species. This fungus is primarily distributed across Europe and North America, where it can be found in grasslands, meadows, and pastures, particularly in areas with low nutrient levels and little disturbance. It prefers moist, acidic soil and can be encountered from late spring to late autumn.\n\nThe spores of Cuphophyllus virgineus are smooth, ellipsoidal, and measure approximately 6-8 x 3.5-5 µm. It produces a large number of spores, with a single mature fruiting body capable of releasing millions of them. These spores are dispersed by the wind, allowing the fungus to colonize new areas. Cuphophyllus virgineus is considered edible, although it is not highly valued as a culinary ingredient due to its mild taste and slimy texture.

Members of this family typically have a cap with a convex to flattened shape, and their gills are usually thick, well-spaced, and either decurrent or adnate. The stem is generally central and can vary in length and thickness depending on the species.\n\nSome advanced scientific studies have identified certain species within the Hygrophoraceae family as being bioluminescent, as well as having potential medicinal properties due to the presence of bioactive compounds. The Hygrophoraceae family is widely distributed across the globe, with species found in various habitats, such as deciduous and coniferous forests, grasslands, and alpine regions. They are predominantly found in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe spores of Hygrophoraceae fungi are typically smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid, with sizes varying depending on the species. Spore production can also vary greatly among different species, with some producing a larger number of spores than others. The spores are dispersed by the wind, allowing the fungi to colonize new areas.\n\nWhile many species within the Hygrophoraceae family are considered edible and some even prized for their taste, others can be inedible or mildly toxic, causing gastrointestinal symptoms if consumed. It is important for mushroom foragers to exercise caution and accurately identify species before consumption to avoid potential health issues.","dates":{"added":1668208444,"dateRange":{"0":1253866974,"1":1679248189}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.347Z","title":"Hygrophoraceae - Гигрофоровые - Waxy Caps - Schnecklinge"}
