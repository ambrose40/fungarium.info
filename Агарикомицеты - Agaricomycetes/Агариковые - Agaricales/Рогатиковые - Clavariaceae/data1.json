The fruiting bodies of this species are characterized by their slender, unbranched, and often curved, finger-like projections that grow to heights of 3-8 cm.\n\nThe surface of the fruiting body is smooth and typically yellow to yellowish-orange in color. As the fungus ages, its tips may become darker.\n\nThe spores of Clavulinopsis corniculata are ellipsoid, hyaline, and measure approximately 5.5-8 x 3.5-5 µm in size. The basidia, which produce the spores, are located on the outer surface of the fruiting body.\n\nThis saprotrophic fungus feeds on decaying organic matter, particularly plant debris, and plays a vital role in nutrient recycling within its ecosystems.\n\nClavulinopsis corniculata is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and other open habitats with well-drained, often sandy or calcareous soils.\n\nThe Meadow Coral has a broad distribution, occurring in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. It typically fruits during the summer and autumn months.\n\nClavulinopsis corniculata is considered inedible due to its tough, fibrous texture and small size.

This family consists of approximately 30 genera and 500 species worldwide. The fungi in this family exhibit a variety of shapes and sizes, including coral-like branching structures, simple clubs, and more complex forms.\n\nCoral fungi are characterized by their fruiting bodies (basidiocarps), which grow above ground and are typically composed of densely packed, elongated branches. The fruiting bodies can range in size from less than 1 cm to over 20 cm in height.\n\nThe color of these fungi varies widely, from white, yellow, and orange to pink, purple, and brown. Their texture is often brittle or waxy, and they usually grow on the ground or on decaying wood.\n\nThe spore-producing structures, known as basidia, are found lining the surfaces of the branches. Spores are typically smooth, hyaline (transparent), and vary in size and shape depending on the species.\n\nCoral fungi are saprotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by decomposing dead organic material. They play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.\n\nThese fungi can be found in a wide range of habitats, from temperate to tropical forests, as well as grasslands and other environments where decaying plant material is present.\n\nSome species of Clavariaceae are edible and appreciated for their unique appearance and texture. However, many species are not recommended for consumption due to their tough or bitter taste.\n\nIt is essential to exercise caution when foraging for edible coral fungi, as some species may resemble toxic or inedible mushrooms.\n\nCoral fungi can be challenging to identify to the species level, as many of them have similar appearances. Microscopic examination and molecular techniques are often required for accurate identification.\n\nThe study of Clavariaceae has led to the discovery of unique compounds with potential pharmacological applications, such as antibacterial and antifungal properties.","dates":{"added":1633205755,"dateRange":{"0":1253346722,"1":1633181077}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.371Z","title":"Clavariaceae - Рогатиковые - Coral Fungi - Korallenpilze"}
