This fungus is commonly found in forests, especially in damp and humid areas. It is a saprobic species, which means that it obtains its nutrients from decomposing organic matter, such as dead leaves and wood.\n\nThe cap of R. roridus ranges from 1-4cm in diameter and is pale yellow or cream-colored. Its stem is usually about 2-5cm long and 1-2mm thick. The gills are densely packed and are a pale color when young, but become darker as they mature.\n\nR. roridus is known for its unique spores, which have a distinct shape that resembles a rugby ball. These spores are typically 9-14µm long and 5-8µm wide, and have a warty surface.\n\nChemically, R. roridus contains a number of bioactive compounds, including roridin A, roridin E, and verrucarin A. These compounds have been shown to have potent antitumor and antifungal properties, making them potential candidates for the development of new pharmaceuticals.\n\nResearch has also shown that R. roridus has an important role in soil ecology, as it helps to break down organic matter and recycle nutrients. Additionally, this fungus has been found to be an indicator species for forest health, as it is sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture levels.\n\nOverall, Roridomyces roridus is an intriguing fungus with a variety of unique features and potential uses in scientific research.","dates":{"added":1472513266,"dateRange":{"0":1472510846,"1":1472510876}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:30.304Z","title":"Roridomyces roridus - Роридомицес росистый - Dewdrop mushroom - Tropfenschleierling"}
