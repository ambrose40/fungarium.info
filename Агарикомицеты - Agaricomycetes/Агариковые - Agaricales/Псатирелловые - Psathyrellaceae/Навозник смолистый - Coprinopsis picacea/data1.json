The cap measures 3 to 10 cm in diameter, with a conical to bell-shaped form and a black and white spotted appearance, giving it the name \"magpie.\"\n\nThe gills of the Magpie Inkcap are initially white, turning black and deliquescent as they mature, eventually liquefying into a black, inky substance. The stipe measures 5 to 15 cm tall and 1 to 1.5 cm thick, is hollow, and has a white or pale gray color.\n\nCoprinopsis picacea is considered inedible due to its extremely bitter taste, and some reports suggest that it could be toxic if consumed in large quantities.\n\nThe spores of the Magpie Inkcap are ellipsoid, measuring 11 to 16 µm in length and 7 to 9 µm in width, with a dark brown to black spore print.\n\nThis mushroom is typically found in deciduous and mixed forests, where it grows on decaying wood, stumps, and buried wood debris, often in small groups or clusters.\n\nCoprinopsis picacea has a wide distribution, occurring across North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe chemistry of the Magpie Inkcap is not well-studied, but it is known to contain various compounds responsible for its unique appearance, including melanin-like pigments.\n\nThe ecological role of Coprinopsis picacea is that of a decomposer, breaking down dead organic matter and contributing to nutrient recycling within ecosystems.\n\nThe Magpie Inkcap's striking appearance makes it an interesting subject for photography and study by amateur mycologists.\n\nDespite its inedibility, Coprinopsis picacea has been used in traditional medicine for its potential antiviral and antibacterial properties.\n\nDue to its habitat preferences, the Magpie Inkcap can be an indicator of healthy forest ecosystems, as it relies on the presence of decaying wood for growth.","dates":{"added":1431193835,"dateRange":{"0":1301658144,"1":1301658146}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:46.372Z","title":"Coprinopsis picacea - Навозник смолистый - Magpie Inkcap - Specht-Tintling"}
