This family consists of over 400 species, including many well-known genera such as Psathyrella, Coprinellus, and Coprinopsis. The fungi in this family are characterized by their thin, delicate fruiting bodies and their ability to rapidly decay and deliquesce, which aids in spore dispersal.\n\nMost Psathyrellaceae species have caps that are initially convex, becoming flat or sometimes umbrella-shaped as they mature. The cap colors vary but are often shades of brown, gray, or white. The gills are typically crowded, and their color may change as the spores mature.\n\nThe stipes of Psathyrellaceae fungi are usually thin and fragile, often hollow or filled with a cottony pith. Some species have a partial veil that may leave remnants on the cap or a fragile ring on the stipe.\n\nMembers of the Psathyrellaceae family are saprobic, decomposing dead organic matter such as leaf litter, wood, and dung. They play a vital role in breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients in various ecosystems.\n\nThe spores of Psathyrellaceae fungi are typically smooth, dark brown to black, and ellipsoid or ovoid in shape. The spore print color can range from brownish-black to purple-black, depending on the species.\n\nPsathyrellaceae fungi are widely distributed and can be found throughout the world. They inhabit a range of environments, including forests, grasslands, and urban settings, with some species being more specific to certain habitats or substrates.\n\nThe edibility of Psathyrellaceae mushrooms varies, with some being edible and others potentially toxic.
