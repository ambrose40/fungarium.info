This cosmopolitan species, typically found from late spring to early winter, is known for its convex to bell-shaped cap measuring 1-5 cm in diameter, which may flatten with age. The mushroom's dark brown to black gills are adnate or slightly attached to the stem, and the spore print is brown. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 12-15 x 7-9 micrometers.\n\nThis species grows in trooping or solitary groups in grassy areas, often in nutrient-rich or manured soil, and is frequent in gardens and pastures. Although it is saprobic, feeding on decaying organic matter, it's been found in mycorrhizal association with grasses as well.\n\nThe Haymaker's Mushroom is often mistaken for the hallucinogenic Panaeolus cinctulus due to their similar appearances. However, P. foenisecii is generally considered non-toxic, but some sources suggest it might contain small amounts of the hallucinogenic compound psilocybin. Studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s led to contradicting results, some indicating the presence of psilocybin and others denying it. Current consensus leans towards its absence or negligible content.\n\nIts common name \"Haymaker's Mushroom\" derives from its propensity to appear in hay fields. It is also sometimes called the \"mower's mushroom\" for the same reason. Interestingly, it has been associated with the \"fairy ring\" phenomenon, where mushrooms grow in a circle creating the folklore of a fairy's dancing circle. Despite its common occurrence, it's not generally recommended for culinary use due to its insubstantial size and potential for confusion with other species.","dates":{"added":1691016468,"dateRange":{"0":1658237743,"1":1690914440}},"fileDate":"2023-08-03T01:47:48.22Z","category":"folder","title":"Panaeolina foenisecii - Панеолина сенокосная - Brown Mottlegill - Heudüngerling"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Panaeolus%20papilionaceus","deepCounters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"counters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Panaeolus%20papilionaceus\/thumbs\/0DSC07591.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Panaeolus papilionaceus - Панеолус мотыльковый - Petticoat Mottlegill - Schmetterlings-Häubling<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Panaeolus papilionaceus, commonly known as the Petticoat Mottlegill, is a basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Bolbitiaceae.
