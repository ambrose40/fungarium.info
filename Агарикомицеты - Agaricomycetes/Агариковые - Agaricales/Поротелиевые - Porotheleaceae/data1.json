This species is characterized by its small size, with a cap measuring only 1 to 3 cm in diameter. The cap is convex to flat, and its color ranges from pinkish-orange to reddish-brown, often with a lighter margin.\n\nThe gills of Atheniella adonis are adnexed to slightly decurrent, meaning they are narrowly attached to the stipe and may extend slightly down it. The gills have a pinkish to beige color, which may become darker with age. The stipe is slender, measuring 2 to 5 cm in height and 0.1 to 0.3 cm in thickness. It is typically white to pale pink, with a slightly fibrillose surface.\n\nAtheniella adonis is a saprobic fungus, meaning it decomposes dead organic matter, such as leaf litter and plant debris. The exact role of this species in nutrient cycling within ecosystems is not well understood, but like other saprobic fungi, it is assumed to play a role in breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients.\n\nThe distribution of Atheniella adonis is poorly documented due to its rarity and inconspicuous nature. It has been reported in Europe, but its full range and global distribution remain unclear. The fruiting period for this mushroom is not well known but is assumed to occur from late spring to autumn.\n\nThe spores of Atheniella adonis are smooth, ellipsoid, and pale yellowish in color. They measure approximately 6 to 8 µm in length and 4 to 5 µm in width. The spore print color is not well documented but is assumed to be pale yellowish based on the spore morphology.\n\nDue to the rarity and limited information available on Atheniella adonis, its edibility and toxicity are unknown. It is generally advised to avoid consuming this mushroom due to the potential risk of toxicity or adverse reactions.\n\nThe habitat of Atheniella adonis includes various forest types, where it is typically found growing on decaying leaf litter or plant debris. The specific environmental conditions and substrates preferred by this species are not well documented due to its rarity.\n\nThe chemical composition of Atheniella adonis is not well understood, and few studies have been conducted to investigate the presence of bioactive compounds or other chemicals within this fungus.","dates":{"added":1664064137,"dateRange":{"0":1663760903,"1":1663761104}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:42.665Z","category":"folder","title":"Atheniella adonis - Атениелла адониса - Adonis Atheniella - Adonis-Atheniella"},{"path":"%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B0%20%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Atheniella%20flavoalba","deepCounters":{"total":11,"images":11,"files":11},"counters":{"total":11,"images":11,"files":11},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%90%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B0%20%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Atheniella%20flavoalba\/thumbs\/DSC05883.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Atheniella flavoalba - Атениелла желто-белая - Yellow-White Atheniella - Gelb-Weiße Atheniella<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Atheniella flavoalba, also known as the Yellow-White Atheniella, is a rare and understudied basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the Porotheleaceae family.

This family is relatively small and less known compared to other fungal families. The Porotheleaceae contains several genera, including Porotheleum and Phaeomarasmius.\n\nMushrooms belonging to the Porotheleaceae family are characterized by their small to medium size, brown or dark brown coloration, and often inconspicuous appearance. These fungi generally have a convex to umbilicate cap, with a smooth or finely fibrillose surface.\n\nThe gills of Porotheleaceae species can be adnate, adnexed, or sometimes seceding. The spore print color varies from white to pale brown, depending on the species. The stipe is usually slender and cylindrical, with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface.\n\nThe spores of Porotheleaceae fungi are generally smooth and ellipsoid to oblong in shape. The size of the spores can vary significantly depending on the genus and species.\n\nMembers of the Porotheleaceae family are typically saprobic, decomposing organic matter such as leaf litter, wood debris, and other plant materials.

The fruiting period for these mushrooms generally occurs from late spring to autumn, depending on the region and species.\n\nPorotheleaceae fungi can be found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and other areas with decaying plant material. They are often associated with specific substrates, such as decaying wood, leaf litter, or other plant debris.\n\nMany species within the Porotheleaceae family are inconspicuous and challenging to find due to their small size and cryptic coloration. This characteristic has likely contributed to the limited information available on the biology and ecology of these fungi.\n\nThere is currently limited information available regarding the edibility or toxicity of Porotheleaceae species. As a result, it is generally advised to avoid consuming these mushrooms due to the potential risk of toxicity or adverse reactions.\n\nThe chemical composition of Porotheleaceae species is not well understood, and few studies have been conducted to investigate the presence of bioactive compounds or other chemicals within these fungi.\n\nIt is possible that Porotheleaceae species may have potential ecological, industrial, or medical applications.
