The cap of this mushroom is convex, with a diameter of up to 10 cm, and it is typically reddish-brown or purple-brown in color. The stem is also reddish-brown and can grow up to 15 cm tall.\n\nThis mushroom is typically found in coniferous forests, particularly under spruce trees. It is commonly found in Europe, particularly in northern and central regions, and is also found in North America. Cortinarius callisteus is mycorrhizal, meaning it forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of trees.\n\nCortinarius callisteus contains the toxin orellanine, which can cause kidney damage if ingested. However, it is not considered deadly toxic and is still consumed in some European countries after thorough cooking.\n\nThe spores of Cortinarius callisteus are elliptical in shape, smooth, and measure 8-11 x 5-6 µm. Studies have shown that this species may be capable of sequestering heavy metals such as lead and cadmium from the soil, making it potentially useful for bioremediation.\n\nIn addition to its potential uses in bioremediation, Cortinarius callisteus has also been studied for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and may have potential as a medicinal mushroom.","dates":{"added":1633205755,"dateRange":{"0":1633176984,"1":1633177011}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:38.391Z","category":"folder","title":"Cortinarius callisteus - Паутинник придорожный - Beautiful Webcap - Schöner Schleierling"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Cortinarius%20purpureus","deepCounters":{"total":6,"images":6,"files":6},"counters":{"total":6,"images":6,"files":6},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Cortinarius%20purpureus\/thumbs\/fungi-0003538.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Cortinarius purpureus - Паутинник пурпурный - Purple Webcap - Purpurschleierling<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Cortinarius purpureus, commonly known as the Purple Webcap or Purpurschleierling, is a medium-sized basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the family&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Паутинник пурпурный - Cortinarius purpureus","comment":"Cortinarius purpureus, commonly known as the Purple Webcap or Purpurschleierling, is a medium-sized basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the family Cortinariaceae.

This mushroom can serve as an indicator species, providing information about the overall health of a forest and the effectiveness of conservation efforts.","dates":{"added":1472860275,"dateRange":{"0":1253871480,"1":1443247441}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:40.599Z","category":"folder","title":"Cortinarius cinnamomeus - Паутинник коричный - Cinnamon Webcap - Zimtbrauner Schleierling"}],"name":"Паутинниковые - Cortinariaceae","comment":"The Cortinariaceae family is a group of basidiomycete fungi belonging to the order Agaricales, containing several genera, including the well-known Cortinarius genus, which is one of the largest genera of agarics, with over 2000 species worldwide.\n\nMembers of this family are characterized by their cortina, a veil-like structure made of fine web-like filaments that protect the developing gills in young fruiting bodies. The cortina often leaves a ring or zone of fibrils on the stem as the fruiting body matures.\n\nCortinariaceae fungi have medium to large fruiting bodies, which are often colorful, displaying shades of brown, purple, orange, or red.\n\nThey can be found in various habitats, such as forests, woodlands, and grasslands, with many species forming mycorrhizal relationships with trees or shrubs, helping them absorb nutrients and water from the soil.\n\nThe Cortinariaceae family has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australasia.\n\nSpore prints of Cortinariaceae fungi are typically brown, rusty-brown, or ochre, and their spores are ornamented with warts, ridges, or reticulations, depending on the species.\n\nCortinariaceae fungi are known for their diverse range of odors, with some species having a pleasant smell, while others may have an unpleasant or even pungent odor.\n\nThe edibility of Cortinariaceae fungi is highly variable. Some species, such as Cortinarius caperatus, are edible and even considered choice by some, while others contain toxic compounds and can cause severe poisoning or even death, as in the case of Cortinarius orellanus and Cortinarius rubellus.\n\nDue to the risk of misidentifying toxic species, it is strongly advised not to consume any Cortinariaceae fungi unless they have been positively identified by an expert.\n\nEcologically, Cortinariaceae fungi play essential roles in nutrient cycling and maintaining the health of their host plants by forming mycorrhizal associations.\n\nCortinariaceae species exhibit considerable morphological variation, making identification challenging. Microscopic examination of spores, gill structure, and other features is often necessary for accurate identification.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have significantly impacted the classification of Cortinariaceae, revealing new relationships between species and genera, and sometimes leading to the reassignment of species to different genera.\n\nSome Cortinariaceae species, such as Cortinarius violaceus, are known for their striking appearance, with deep violet or purple fruiting bodies that can be visually striking in their natural habitat.\n\nCortinariaceae fungi have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures, and recent research has identified bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and antimicrobial agents, which may have potential applications in modern medicine.","dates":{"added":1664725500,"dateRange":{"0":1250159584,"1":1664636200}},"fileDate":"2023-03-19T22:23:50.997Z","title":"Cortinariaceae - Паутинниковые - Webcap mushrooms - Schleierlingsverwandte"}
