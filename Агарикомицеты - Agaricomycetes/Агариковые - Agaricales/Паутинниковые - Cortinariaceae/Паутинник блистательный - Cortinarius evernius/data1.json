This mushroom is mycorrhizal, meaning that it forms a mutually beneficial relationship with trees and other plants.\n\nThe cap of C. evernius ranges from 3-10cm in diameter and is convex to flat, with a smooth and shiny surface. Its stem is usually about 5-10cm long and is tough and fibrous. The gills are initially pale yellowish-white, but become rusty brown as the mushroom matures. The spore print of C. evernius is rusty brown, and the spores themselves are elliptical and ornamented with small bumps, typically measuring 8-10µm in length.\n\nChemically, C. evernius contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including toxins and psychoactive substances. Some studies have shown that this fungus has antioxidant and antibacterial properties.\n\nC. evernius is often found growing in mixed forests, and can be found in a variety of habitats, including old-growth and second-growth forests. It is distributed throughout North America and Europe.\n\nIn addition to its ecological and medicinal importance, C. evernius is also of interest to mycologists due to its taxonomic complexity. This species is part of a group of closely related fungi that are difficult to distinguish from one another.\n\nInterestingly, C. evernius has been shown to have potential as a bioindicator of heavy metal contamination in the environment. Studies have shown that this fungus accumulates high levels of heavy metals in its tissues, making it a useful tool for monitoring environmental pollution.\n\nOverall, Cortinarius evernius is an important and fascinating fungus with a wide range of potential uses in scientific research and environmental monitoring. However, due to its toxic and psychoactive properties, it should be handled with caution by those without proper training.","dates":{"added":1444565102,"dateRange":{"0":1253868371,"1":1253869480}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:36.18Z","title":"Cortinarius evernius - Паутинник блистательный - Shiny Cortinarius - Glänzender Schleimkopf"}
