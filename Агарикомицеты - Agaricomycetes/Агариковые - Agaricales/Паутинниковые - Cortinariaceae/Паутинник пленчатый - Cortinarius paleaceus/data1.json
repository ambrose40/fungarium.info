This mushroom has a convex cap that becomes flat or depressed with age, and its color ranges from light brown to reddish-brown. The cap surface is covered with whitish fibers or scales, which are remnants of the universal veil. The gills are initially pale violet-grey but turn rusty-brown as they mature. The stalk is slender and has a ring, or annulus, that is membranous and hangs like a skirt. The mushroom's flesh is whitish and has a mild taste.\n\nCortinarius paleaceus is found in coniferous and mixed forests of Europe, North America, and Asia. It grows on the ground, often near coniferous trees, from late summer to autumn. The mushroom forms mycorrhizal associations with the roots of these trees, which benefit both the tree and the fungus.\n\nThe spores of Cortinarius paleaceus are rusty-brown, elliptical, and measure about 8\u201311 x 5\u20137 micrometers. They are covered with warts and ridges, which can be seen under a microscope. The spore print is rusty-brown.\n\nCortinarius paleaceus contains the pigment cortinarubin, which is responsible for its rusty-brown color. This pigment is a precursor to the more well-known cortinarius pigment cortinarius violaceus, which is responsible for the purple coloration of many webcaps. Cortinarubin has been found to have antioxidant properties.\n\nResearch has shown that some species of Cortinarius, including C. paleaceus, contain bioactive compounds that have potential therapeutic uses, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antimicrobial properties. However, more research is needed before these compounds can be used in medical treatments.","dates":{"added":1475785322,"dateRange":{"0":1252669897,"1":1252669925}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:37.840Z","title":"Cortinarius paleaceus - Паутинник пленчатый - Slender Webcap - Blassblättriger "}
