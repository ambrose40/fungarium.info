It is commonly known as the Beautiful Webcap due to its striking appearance. The cap of this mushroom is convex, with a diameter of up to 10 cm, and it is typically reddish-brown or purple-brown in color. The stem is also reddish-brown and can grow up to 15 cm tall.\n\nThis mushroom is typically found in coniferous forests, particularly under spruce trees. It is commonly found in Europe, particularly in northern and central regions, and is also found in North America. Cortinarius callisteus is mycorrhizal, meaning it forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of trees.\n\nCortinarius callisteus contains the toxin orellanine, which can cause kidney damage if ingested. However, it is not considered deadly toxic and is still consumed in some European countries after thorough cooking.\n\nThe spores of Cortinarius callisteus are elliptical in shape, smooth, and measure 8-11 x 5-6 µm. Studies have shown that this species may be capable of sequestering heavy metals such as lead and cadmium from the soil, making it potentially useful for bioremediation.\n\nIn addition to its potential uses in bioremediation, Cortinarius callisteus has also been studied for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and may have potential as a medicinal mushroom.","dates":{"added":1633205755,"dateRange":{"0":1633176984,"1":1633177011}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:50:38.391Z","title":"Cortinarius callisteus - Паутинник придорожный - Beautiful Webcap - Schöner Schleierling"}
