This association is vital for the health and nutrient uptake of the tree.\n\nThis fungus can be found in various habitats where alder trees are present, such as wetlands, riverbanks, and mixed woodlands.\n\nThe distribution of A. scolecina spans across Europe and North America, with a preference for temperate regions.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Alnicola scolecina usually appear from late summer to autumn, depending on local climate conditions.\n\nSpores of A. scolecina are elliptical, smooth, and measure approximately 7-9 x 4-5 micrometers. The spore print color is pale ochre to pale brown.\n\nThe edibility of Alnicola scolecina is considered unknown, and it is not recommended for consumption due to the frequent presence of larvae and the possibility of confusion with toxic species.\n\nChemical analysis of A. scolecina has not been extensively conducted, and information regarding its specific compounds is limited.\n\nIt is essential to exercise caution when identifying A. scolecina, as it shares similarities with other potentially toxic species.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1683110131,"1":1683110167}},"fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:47:04.749Z","category":"folder","title":"Alnicola scolecina - Альникола червивая - Wormy Alnicola - Wurmiger Erlen-Rotling"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Galerina%20pumila","deepCounters":{"total":25,"images":25,"files":25},"counters":{"total":25,"images":25,"files":25},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Galerina%20pumila\/thumbs\/0DSC05988.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Galerina pumila - Галерина карликовая - Dwarf Galerina - Zwergige Galerina<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Galerina pumila, commonly known as the Dwarf Galerina or Zwergige Galerina, is a small basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the family Hymenogastraceae.

Members of this family are characterized by their diverse forms, which can range from small, inconspicuous mushrooms to larger, more conspicuous fruiting bodies.\n\nHymenogastraceae species exhibit a wide variety of colors, shapes, and textures, making them difficult to identify without expert knowledge. They can be found in a range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Many of these fungi are saprophytic, decomposing organic material, while others form ectomycorrhizal relationships with various plants, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.\n\nSpore morphology varies across the Hymenogastraceae family, with some species producing smooth, ellipsoidal spores, while others have ornamented or irregularly shaped spores. Spore sizes also vary, depending on the species. These fungi generally produce a large number of spores, with mature fruiting bodies capable of releasing millions of them into the environment.\n\nThe distribution of Hymenogastraceae species is widespread, with representatives found on all continents except Antarctica. Some species within this family are known to be edible, such as certain Hebeloma species, but others can be toxic, causing gastrointestinal distress or other symptoms if consumed.\n\nDue to the diversity and complexity of the Hymenogastraceae family, it is essential for mushroom foragers to exercise caution when collecting mushrooms, as misidentification can lead to accidental consumption of toxic species. It is advisable to consult field guides, expert mycologists, or local mycological societies for accurate identification and advice on edibility.","dates":{"added":1683384424,"dateRange":{"0":1410605431,"1":1683110167}},"fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:41:00.915Z","title":"Hymenogastraceae - Гименогастровые - Hymenogastraceae Family - Hymenogastraceae Familie"}
