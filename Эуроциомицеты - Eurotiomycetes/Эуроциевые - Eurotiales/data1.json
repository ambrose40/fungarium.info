Taxa are saprobes with aggressive colonization strategies, adaptable to extreme environmental conditions. Family members are cosmopolitan in distribution, ubiquitous in soil, and common associates of decaying plant and food material. The family contains some of the most familiar fungi, such as Penicillium and Aspergillus. It has been proposed that the family should be split into the three families Aspergillaceae, Thermoascaceae and Trichocomaceae.","dates":{"added":1527839350,"dateRange":{"0":1227578428,"1":1523190444}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.689Z","category":"folder","title":"Трихокомовые - Trichocomaceae"}],"name":"Эуроциевые - Eurotiales","comment":"The Eurotiales are an order of sac fungi, also known as the green and blue molds.
