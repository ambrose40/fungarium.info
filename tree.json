This family is characterized by their distinctive fruiting body, which typically includes a cap, stalk, and skirt-like annulus.\n\nThe fruiting body of Amanitaceae is typically large and showy, with a cap that can range from white to yellow, brown, or red. The cap is often covered in warts or scales, which can be used to help identify different species. The spores of Amanitaceae are produced in basidia, which are elongated cells that contain four spores each.\n\nAmanitaceae fungi are mycorrhizal, meaning they form mutualistic relationships with the roots of trees. They exchange nutrients for carbon in a process that benefits both the fungus and the host plant. Some species are also toxic, producing potent toxins that can cause severe illness or death if ingested.\n\nThis family includes many highly toxic species, including Amanita phalloides, commonly known as the Death cap, and Amanita virosa, the Destroying angel. These fungi are responsible for the majority of mushroom poisonings worldwide and should never be consumed. Some species of Amanitaceae are also used in traditional medicine, where they are believed to have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.\n\nAmanitaceae fungi are widely distributed and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are most commonly found in temperate regions, but can also be found in tropical and arctic regions.\n\nIn conclusion, Amanitaceae is a fascinating and important family of fungi. Its members include some of the most toxic and deadly fungi in the world, as well as important mycorrhizal partners in forest ecosystems. The distinctive morphologies and lifestyles of these fungi make them an important and fascinating group for scientific study.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.339Z","title":"Amanitaceae - Аманитовые - Amanita family - Wulstlingsverwandte"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Bolbitiaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Bolbitius%20titubans","counters":{"total":9,"images":9,"files":9},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Bolbitius%20titubans\/thumbs\/0DSC07384.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Больбитий золотистый - Bolbitius titubans","comment":"Bolbitius titubans, commonly known as the Yellow Fieldcap, is a basidiomycete fungus belonging to the Bolbitiaceae family.

The mushroom's dark brown to black gills are adnate or slightly attached to the stem, and the spore print is brown. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 12-15 x 7-9 micrometers.\n\nThis species grows in trooping or solitary groups in grassy areas, often in nutrient-rich or manured soil, and is frequent in gardens and pastures. Although it is saprobic, feeding on decaying organic matter, it's been found in mycorrhizal association with grasses as well.\n\nThe Haymaker's Mushroom is often mistaken for the hallucinogenic Panaeolus cinctulus due to their similar appearances. However, P. foenisecii is generally considered non-toxic, but some sources suggest it might contain small amounts of the hallucinogenic compound psilocybin. Studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s led to contradicting results, some indicating the presence of psilocybin and others denying it.

It is also sometimes called the \"mower's mushroom\" for the same reason. Interestingly, it has been associated with the \"fairy ring\" phenomenon, where mushrooms grow in a circle creating the folklore of a fairy's dancing circle. Despite its common occurrence, it's not generally recommended for culinary use due to its insubstantial size and potential for confusion with other species.","fileDate":"2023-08-03T01:47:48.22Z","title":"Panaeolina foenisecii - Панеолина сенокосная - Brown Mottlegill - Heudüngerling"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Panaeolus%20papilionaceus","counters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Panaeolus%20papilionaceus\/thumbs\/0DSC07591.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Панеолус мотыльковый - Panaeolus papilionaceus","comment":"Panaeolus papilionaceus, commonly known as the Petticoat Mottlegill, is a basidiomycete fungus belonging to the family Bolbitiaceae.

This family comprises various genera, including Pleurotus, Hohenbuehelia, and Sarcomyxa. Species within this family are characterized by their eccentrically stemmed or lateral fruiting bodies, which often lack a distinct stalk or have a very reduced one.\n\nMembers of the Pleurotaceae family are predominantly saprotrophic fungi, meaning they obtain nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter, particularly wood. Some species are also known to form weak parasitic relationships with living trees.\n\nThese fungi are widely distributed across the globe, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. They can be found in various habitats, including woodlands, forests, and on decaying logs or stumps.\n\nThe spore-producing surface of Pleurotaceae fungi is usually a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface rather than the gills typically seen in other agarics. Spore prints of these fungi can vary in color, depending on the species, and can range from white to pale lilac.\n\nThe number of spores produced by a single fruiting body within this family can vary greatly, depending on factors such as species, environmental conditions, and the size of the fruiting body, but generally, millions of spores can be produced by a single mushroom.\n\nSome species within the Pleurotaceae family, particularly those belonging to the Pleurotus genus, are highly valued for their culinary and medicinal properties. For example, the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is a popular edible mushroom with potential health benefits.\n\nIn addition to their culinary and medicinal value, some Pleurotaceae fungi have also been studied for their potential in bioremediation, which is the process of using living organisms to clean up environmental pollution.\n\nProper identification is essential when foraging for mushrooms in this family, as some members may have toxic look-alikes.\n\nIn German, the Pleurotaceae family is known as Seitlingsverwandte, which reflects the unique growth habit of these fungi, often featuring eccentrically stemmed or lateral fruiting bodies.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.342Z","title":"Pleurotaceae - Вёшенковые - Pleurotaceae family - Seitlingsverwandte"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Inocybaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8F%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20nitidiuscula","counters":{"total":7,"images":7,"files":7},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8F%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Inocybe%20nitidiuscula\/thumbs\/0DSC06655.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Волоконница блестящая - Inocybe nitidiuscula","comment":"Inocybe nitidiuscula, commonly known as the Shiny Fibrecap or Glänzender Faserling, is a small, mycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus belonging to the Inocybaceae family.

Members of this family are characterized by their diverse forms, which can range from small, inconspicuous mushrooms to larger, more conspicuous fruiting bodies.\n\nHymenogastraceae species exhibit a wide variety of colors, shapes, and textures, making them difficult to identify without expert knowledge. They can be found in a range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Many of these fungi are saprophytic, decomposing organic material, while others form ectomycorrhizal relationships with various plants, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.\n\nSpore morphology varies across the Hymenogastraceae family, with some species producing smooth, ellipsoidal spores, while others have ornamented or irregularly shaped spores. Spore sizes also vary, depending on the species. These fungi generally produce a large number of spores, with mature fruiting bodies capable of releasing millions of them into the environment.\n\nThe distribution of Hymenogastraceae species is widespread, with representatives found on all continents except Antarctica. Some species within this family are known to be edible, such as certain Hebeloma species, but others can be toxic, causing gastrointestinal distress or other symptoms if consumed.\n\nDue to the diversity and complexity of the Hymenogastraceae family, it is essential for mushroom foragers to exercise caution when collecting mushrooms, as misidentification can lead to accidental consumption of toxic species. It is advisable to consult field guides, expert mycologists, or local mycological societies for accurate identification and advice on edibility.","fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:41:00.915Z","title":"Hymenogastraceae - Гименогастровые - Hymenogastraceae Family - Hymenogastraceae Familie"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Nidulariaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Crucibulum%20laeve","counters":{"total":10,"images":10,"files":10},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Crucibulum%20laeve\/thumbs\/DSC00752_.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Бокальчик гладкий - Crucibulum laeve","comment":"Crucibulum laeve, also known as the Common Bird's Nest or Glatter Nistkuckuckspilz, is a widely distributed fungus belonging to the Nidulariaceae family.

They are characterized by their small to medium-sized fruiting bodies, consisting of a cap, stem, and gills, which are often tough and leathery.\n\nMembers of this family are commonly known as \"marasmioid mushrooms\" due to their distinct fruiting body features, which are resistant to decay and can revive after drying.\n\nMarasmiaceae fungi can be found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and other terrestrial environments. They are primarily decomposers of plant material such as leaves, twigs, and wood, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems.\n\nThe family has a worldwide distribution, with species found in North America, Europe, Asia, and other regions.\n\nMarasmiaceae contains several genera, including Marasmius, Gymnopus, and Crinipellis, which together encompass hundreds of species.\n\nMarasmius, the type genus of the family, is well-known for its species Marasmius oreades, commonly called the \"fairy ring mushroom,\" due to the circular patterns it forms in grassy areas.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Marasmiaceae fungi exhibit a wide range of colors, such as white, brown, gray, or red, with some species having distinct color patterns.\n\nSpore prints of Marasmiaceae fungi are typically white, pale cream, or yellowish, and their spores are smooth, ellipsoid, or elongated.\n\nMarasmiaceae fungi often possess a cartilaginous or tough texture, which enables them to withstand desiccation and revive upon rehydration.\n\nMany Marasmiaceae species have a unique odor, ranging from sweet and fruity to more unpleasant and rank. However, some species may have little to no discernible odor.\n\nThe edibility of Marasmiaceae fungi varies, with some species being edible, such as Marasmius oreades, while others are inedible or of unknown edibility. Consuming unidentified mushrooms can pose a risk, and caution is advised.\n\nSome Marasmiaceae fungi have been reported to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, or cytotoxic properties, which may hold potential for future research in medicine or other fields.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have significantly impacted the classification of Marasmiaceae, revealing new relationships between species and genera.\n\nAccurate identification of Marasmiaceae fungi often requires microscopic analysis of spore morphology, gill attachment, and other features, as well as macroscopic observations of color, size, and habitat.","fileDate":"2023-07-08T02:01:39.806Z","title":"Marasmiaceae - Негниючниковые - Marasmioid mushrooms - Schwindlingsverwandte"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cortinariaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BB%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Gymnopilus%20penetrans","counters":{"total":12,"images":12,"files":12},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BB%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Gymnopilus%20penetrans\/thumbs\/DSC06303.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Гимнопил проникающий - Gymnopilus penetrans","comment":"Gymnopilus penetrans, also known as the straw-yellow gymnopilus, is a basidiomycete fungus that is commonly found in temperate forests around the world.

The fruiting bodies of this species are characterized by their slender, unbranched, and often curved, finger-like projections that grow to heights of 3-8 cm.\n\nThe surface of the fruiting body is smooth and typically yellow to yellowish-orange in color. As the fungus ages, its tips may become darker.\n\nThe spores of Clavulinopsis corniculata are ellipsoid, hyaline, and measure approximately 5.5-8 x 3.5-5 µm in size. The basidia, which produce the spores, are located on the outer surface of the fruiting body.\n\nThis saprotrophic fungus feeds on decaying organic matter, particularly plant debris, and plays a vital role in nutrient recycling within its ecosystems.\n\nClavulinopsis corniculata is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and other open habitats with well-drained, often sandy or calcareous soils.\n\nThe Meadow Coral has a broad distribution, occurring in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

This family consists of approximately 30 genera and 500 species worldwide. The fungi in this family exhibit a variety of shapes and sizes, including coral-like branching structures, simple clubs, and more complex forms.\n\nCoral fungi are characterized by their fruiting bodies (basidiocarps), which grow above ground and are typically composed of densely packed, elongated branches. The fruiting bodies can range in size from less than 1 cm to over 20 cm in height.\n\nThe color of these fungi varies widely, from white, yellow, and orange to pink, purple, and brown. Their texture is often brittle or waxy, and they usually grow on the ground or on decaying wood.\n\nThe spore-producing structures, known as basidia, are found lining the surfaces of the branches. Spores are typically smooth, hyaline (transparent), and vary in size and shape depending on the species.\n\nCoral fungi are saprotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by decomposing dead organic material. They play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.\n\nThese fungi can be found in a wide range of habitats, from temperate to tropical forests, as well as grasslands and other environments where decaying plant material is present.\n\nSome species of Clavariaceae are edible and appreciated for their unique appearance and texture. However, many species are not recommended for consumption due to their tough or bitter taste.\n\nIt is essential to exercise caution when foraging for edible coral fungi, as some species may resemble toxic or inedible mushrooms.\n\nCoral fungi can be challenging to identify to the species level, as many of them have similar appearances. Microscopic examination and molecular techniques are often required for accurate identification.\n\nThe study of Clavariaceae has led to the discovery of unique compounds with potential pharmacological applications, such as antibacterial and antifungal properties.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.371Z","title":"Clavariaceae -

Tricholomataceae","comment":"The Tricholomataceae is a large family of basidiomycete fungi, which includes many genera and species of gilled mushrooms. This family is part of the order Agaricales and is characterized by its diverse morphological and ecological features.\n\nMembers of the Tricholomataceae family typically have white, cream, or pale-colored spores, and their gills are often attached to the stem or notched. The fruiting bodies generally have a central stipe and a cap with a convex or umbonate shape.\n\nThe habitat preferences of the Tricholomataceae family members are diverse, ranging from terrestrial to wood-inhabiting species. They can be found in various ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, and even urban environments.\n\nTricholomataceae fungi are widely distributed across the globe, with species occurring in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and other regions.\n\nThe ecological roles of Tricholomataceae species are quite diverse, with some species being saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter, while others form mycorrhizal relationships with plants, aiding in nutrient absorption.\n\nSome well-known genera within the Tricholomataceae family include Tricholoma, Clitocybe, Lepista, and Leucopaxillus.\n\nA few species within this family are considered to be choice edibles, such as the Wood Blewit (Lepista nuda) and the Blue Foot Mushroom (Clitocybe nuda). However, many other species are inedible or even toxic.\n\nOne toxic member of this family is the White Clitocybe (Clitocybe dealbata), which contains the toxin muscarine and can cause severe poisoning if consumed.\n\nThe spore sizes and shapes in Tricholomataceae are variable, with most species producing smooth, ellipsoid, or subglobose spores. Spore print colors can range from white to pale cream or even pale pinkish.\n\nMany Tricholomataceae species have a distinctive odor or taste, which can aid in identification. For example, some Tricholoma species have a cucumber-like odor, while others may have a farinaceous or mealy taste.\n\nThe family Tricholomataceae is currently undergoing taxonomic revisions due to advances in molecular phylogenetics. As a result, some genera and species may be reclassified or moved to other families in the future.\n\nTricholomataceae fungi are important components of their ecosystems, as they help decompose organic matter and recycle nutrients. Some species also form beneficial relationships with plants, promoting plant growth and health.\n\nDue to their diverse ecological roles and the presence of both edible and toxic species, it is essential to accurately identify Tricholomataceae fungi before consumption.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.379Z","title":"Tricholomataceae - Рядовковые - Tricholoma family - Ritterlingsverwandte"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sarcomyxaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20-%20Sarcomyxa%20serotina","counters":{"total":22,"images":22,"files":22},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20-%20Sarcomyxa%20serotina\/thumbs\/fungi-0001556.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Саркомикса поздняя - Sarcomyxa serotina","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:51:01.129Z","title":"Sarcomyxa serotina - Саркомикса поздняя - Late Oyster - Spätblättriger Schmierling"}],"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sarcomyxaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20-%20Sarcomyxa%20serotina\/thumbs\/fungi-0001556.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Саркомиксовые - Sarcomyxaceae","comment":"Sarcomyxa serotina, commonly known as the Late Oyster or Late Fall Oyster, is a basidiomycete mushroom belonging to the Sarcomyxaceae family. It is characterized by its fan-shaped or oyster-like, gelatinous fruiting bodies that typically have a grayish, yellowish, or brownish color.\n\nThis mushroom is found on decaying hardwood logs, stumps, and branches, with a preference for beech and oak trees. Its fruiting period occurs mainly in late autumn to early winter, hence its common name \"Late Oyster.\"\n\nThe Late Oyster is widely distributed throughout the temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It can be found in both deciduous and mixed forests, often in large clusters or overlapping rows.\n\nThe cap of Sarcomyxa serotina can measure 3 to 12 cm in diameter, and the upper surface is usually smooth, slimy, or sticky when wet, which helps differentiate it from other oyster mushroom species.\n\nThe gills of this mushroom are white to pale cream in color, descending the short and off-center stipe, which is usually 1 to 4 cm long and 0.5 to 2 cm thick.\n\nSarcomyxa serotina produces white to pale cream-colored spores that are ellipsoid to oblong in shape, measuring 5 to 7.5 x 2 to 3.5 µm in size.\n\nThe Late Oyster has a mild to slightly sweet taste and a pleasant aroma, making it an edible mushroom, although its slimy texture can be less appealing to some people.\n\nIt is recommended to clean and cook Sarcomyxa serotina thoroughly before consumption, as the raw mushroom may cause gastrointestinal discomfort in some individuals.\n\nThe Late Oyster is not considered as highly valued as other oyster mushrooms, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, due to its slimy texture and less desirable taste.\n\nSarcomyxa serotina has been investigated for its potential medicinal properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities, though more research is needed to confirm these benefits.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Sarcomyxa serotina is closely related to other jelly fungi in the Auriculariales order, such as Exidia and Tremella species.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.380Z","title":"Sarcomyxaceae -

Agaricaceae","comment":"The Agaricaceae family, also known as the Agaric family or Champignonartige, is a diverse group of fungi that contains approximately 85 genera and over 1,300 species. This family is part of the Agaricales order, which is one of the largest and most diverse orders within the fungal kingdom.\n\nMembers of the Agaricaceae family are characterized by their gilled fruiting bodies, which typically have a central stipe and a cap. The gills are often free from the stipe or only slightly attached, and the spore print colors can vary widely, from white to pink, brown, or black.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Agaricaceae species can be found in various habitats, including grasslands, forests, and even urban environments. Some species are saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter, while others are ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants.\n\nSome of the most well-known genera within the Agaricaceae family include Agaricus, which contains the widely cultivated white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), and Macrolepiota, which includes the sought-after parasol mushroom (Macrolepiota procera).\n\nThe Agaricaceae family also contains several species that are considered toxic or hallucinogenic, such as some members of the Panaeolus and Psilocybe genera. These mushrooms contain psychoactive compounds, like psilocybin and psilocin, which can cause hallucinations and altered perceptions when consumed.\n\nMany species within the Agaricaceae family are considered edible and are consumed worldwide. In addition to the white button mushroom and parasol mushroom, other popular edible species include the meadow mushroom (Agaricus campestris) and the almond mushroom (Agaricus subrufescens).\n\nHowever, not all members of the Agaricaceae family are safe to consume, and some can be easily confused with toxic species. For example, the yellow-staining mushroom (Agaricus xanthodermus) resembles the edible white button mushroom but can cause gastrointestinal upset when ingested.\n\nSpore sizes and shapes within the Agaricaceae family can vary widely, with some species producing small, round spores and others producing large, elongated spores. The spore-producing structures, or basidia, usually contain two to four spores each.\n\nFruiting bodies of Agaricaceae mushrooms can be found throughout the year, depending on the species and local climate conditions. However, the majority of species tend to fruit in the late summer to early autumn months.\n\nSome species within the Agaricaceae family have been used for medicinal purposes, with research showing potential benefits in areas such as immune support, cancer treatment, and neuroprotection.\n\nThe Agaricaceae family has a worldwide distribution, with species found on every continent except Antarctica. Some species are widespread and abundant, while others have more restricted ranges and are considered rare.","fileDate":"2023-12-25T19:06:04.450Z","title":"Agaricaceae - Шампиньоновые - Agaric family - Champignonartige"},{"path":"%D0%A9%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Schizophyllaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%A9%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Schizophyllum%20commune","counters":{"total":19,"images":19,"files":19},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A9%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Schizophyllum%20commune\/thumbs\/fungi-0003135.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Щелелистник обыкновенный - Schizophyllum commune","comment":"Schizophyllum commune, commonly known as the Split Gill Fungus or Spaltblättling in German, is a widespread and easily recognizable mushroom. This small, fan-shaped fungus has a cap size ranging from 1 to 4 cm in diameter, with a distinctive gill-like structure that appears split or divided longitudinally, hence the name. The cap color varies from white to grayish or light brown, often with a slightly hairy texture.\n\nThis mushroom is one of the most common fungi worldwide, with a distribution covering North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. It thrives in a variety of habitats, most notably on decaying wood, where it plays a significant role in breaking down lignin and cellulose.\n\nThe chemistry of Schizophyllum commune is fascinating, as it produces a variety of biologically active compounds. One such compound, schizophyllan, has potential applications in the medical field, particularly in cancer research and immunostimulating therapies.\n\nThe spores of Schizophyllum commune are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure 4-6 x 2-3 micrometers.

This family belongs to the order Agaricales, which is one of the largest and most diverse orders within the fungal kingdom.\n\nFungi in the Schizophyllaceae family are characterized by their unique fruiting bodies, which have gills that split into two layers when dry and rehydrate when moist. This distinctive feature allows these fungi to withstand periods of desiccation and then revive when conditions become more favorable.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Schizophyllaceae species can be found on wood, particularly dead or decaying wood, in various habitats such as forests, woodlands, and urban environments. They are mainly found on deciduous trees, but some species can also grow on coniferous wood.\n\nMembers of the Schizophyllaceae family are saprotrophic, meaning they decompose organic matter, particularly wood, and play an essential role in recycling nutrients within their ecosystems. Some species are also known to form weak parasitic relationships with living trees, causing white rot in the wood.\n\nThe most well-known genus within the Schizophyllaceae family is Schizophyllum, which includes the commonly studied species Schizophyllum commune. This widespread fungus is one of the most researched wood-decay fungi due to its unique gill structure and ability to produce enzymes that break down wood components.\n\nAnother notable genus in the Schizophyllaceae family is Auriculariopsis, which includes species such as Auriculariopsis ampla and Auriculariopsis albomellea. These fungi are characterized by their irregular, fan-shaped fruiting bodies and gelatinous texture.\n\nSpore sizes and shapes within the Schizophyllaceae family can vary, with some species producing small, elliptical spores, while others produce larger, more irregularly shaped spores. The spore-producing structures, or basidia, usually contain two to four spores each.\n\nFruiting bodies of Schizophyllaceae fungi can be found throughout the year, depending on the species and local climate conditions. However, the majority of species tend to fruit during the cooler months of the year.\n\nAlthough some species within the Schizophyllaceae family have been used for medicinal purposes, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, they are generally not considered edible due to their tough, leathery texture.\n\nThere is ongoing research into the potential medicinal properties of Schizophyllaceae fungi, particularly Schizophyllum commune, which has been found to contain compounds with immunomodulatory, antiviral, and antitumor activities.\n\nThe Schizophyllaceae family has a worldwide distribution, with species found on every continent except Antarctica. Some species, like Schizophyllum commune, are widespread and abundant, while others have more restricted ranges and are considered rare or local.\n\nSchizophyllaceae fungi display a range of colors, from white to gray, brown, or black, and the fruiting bodies can have smooth, hairy, or scaly surfaces. The fruiting bodies are often small to medium in size, typically measuring between 1 and 10 cm in diameter.\n\nMembers of the Schizophyllaceae family have been used in biotechnological applications, such as the production of enzymes for the pulp and paper industry or the treatment of lignocellulosic waste materials.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.401Z","title":"Schizophyllaceae - Щелелистниковые - Split-gill family - Spaltblättlinge"},{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Entolomataceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%20%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20-%20Entoloma%20vernum","counters":{"total":6,"images":6,"files":6},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%20%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F%20-%20Entoloma%20vernum\/thumbs\/0SET08956.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Энтолома весенняя - Entoloma vernum","comment":"Entoloma vernum, known as Spring Entoloma or Frühlings-Schleierling in German, is a small to medium-sized mushroom belonging to the family Entolomataceae.

Boletaceae","comment":"The Boletaceae are a family of mushroom-forming fungi, primarily characterised by small pores on the spore-bearing hymenial surface (at the underside of the mushroom), instead of gills as are found in most agarics. Nearly as widely distributed as the agarics, the family is renowned for hosting some prime edible species highly sought after by mushroom hunters worldwide, such as the cep or king bolete (Boletus edulis). A number of rare or threatened species are also present in the family, that have become the focus of increasing conservation concerns. As a whole, the typical members of the family are commonly known as boletes.\nBoletes are a reasonably safe group of mushrooms for human consumption, as none of them are known to be deadly to adults. Edible bolete species are especially suitable for novice collectors, since they pose little danger of being confused with deadly poisonous mushrooms, such as deadly Amanita species which bear gills instead of pores in their hymenial surface. Some boletes are toxic and may cause gastrointestinal poisoning if consumed, but these are unlikely to be confused with popular edible species in the family.\nThe family has been the subject of extensive systematic revisions in recent years, as some of the early established genera (particularly Boletus, Leccinum and Xerocomus), have revealed to be highly polyphyletic, and the original number of genera within the family had been underestimated. As a result, several new species and genera have been described from Asia, Europe and North America, while many existing species have been transferred to different genera, in concordance with phylogenetic results.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.420Z","title":"Болетовые - Boletaceae"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Hygrophoropsidaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Hygrophoropsis%20aurantiaca","counters":{"total":50,"images":50,"files":50},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Hygrophoropsis%20aurantiaca\/thumbs\/00DSC05832.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Гигрофоропсис оранжевый - Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:51:59.456Z"}],"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Hygrophoropsidaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Hygrophoropsis%20aurantiaca\/thumbs\/00DSC05832.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Гигрофоропсисовые - Hygrophoropsidaceae","comment":"The Hygrophoropsidaceae are a family of mushrooms that are gilled in appearance but lie within the Boletales.

Hygrophoropsidaceae was circumscribed by French mycologist Robert Kühner in 1980, with Hygrophoropsis as the type genus. Unlike most members of the Boletales, Hygrophoropsidaceae species are saprophytic wood-rotting fungi that cause brown rot in their hosts.

Unlike other boletes, all members of Gomphidiaceae (except for Gomphogaster) are agarics, having gills instead of pores. Member genera include Chroogomphus, Cystogomphus, Gomphidius and Gomphogaster, the last being a monotypic genus (i.e. with a single species) that may be incorporated into Gomphidius in the future after molecular assessment. The similarly named genus Gomphus is unrelated to this family. Another genus Brauniellula has since been sunk into Chroogomphus.\nLike all agarics, this group was formerly classified in Agaricales. Nonetheless, many of the microscopic features of these fungi, such as spore shape, strongly suggested an affinity with Boletales. This was later confirmed through molecular phylogenetic investigation, which demonstrated that Gomphidiaceae are more closely related to boletes than the \"true\" agarics of the Agaricales and that the development of gills in this group was an independent evolutionary event from the development of gills in the Agaricales. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have also demonstrated Gomphidiaceae are nested well within Boletales, being more closely related to Suillaceae than to Boletaceae, a finding that is supported by chemotaxonomic investigation of these groups.\nThis family of fungi has been thought to be ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationship with their host trees, however, there is now evidence that many (and perhaps all) species in this group are parasitic upon ectomycorrhizal boletes, in relationships that are often highly species-specific.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.425Z","title":"Мокруховые - Gomphidiaceae"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rhizopogonaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20obtectus","counters":{"total":12,"images":12,"files":12},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20obtectus\/thumbs\/DSC06269.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Ризопогон желтоватый - Rhizopogon obtectus","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:12.690Z"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20vulgaris","counters":{"total":12,"images":12,"files":12},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20vulgaris\/thumbs\/DSC01621.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Ризопогон обыкновенный - Rhizopogon vulgaris","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:12.984Z"}],"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rhizopogonaceae\/%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Rhizopogon%20vulgaris\/thumbs\/DSC01621.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Ризопогоновые - Rhizopogonaceae","comment":"Rhizopogonaceae are a family of fungi in the order Boletales.

The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies, beetles and other insects to help disperse the spores.

The Gloeophyllaceae family is the more well-known of the two, containing several species of fungi that decompose coniferous wood.\n\nFungi within the Gloeophyllales order are known for their production of extracellular enzymes, which help break down complex plant materials like lignocellulose.\n\nGloeophyllales fungi are typically found in forests and wooded areas where there is a constant source of deadwood for them to consume.\n\nThese fungi are widespread, being found in various regions around the world, including Europe, North America, and Asia.\n\nSome common species within the Gloeophyllaceae family include Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Rusty Gilled Polypore), Gloeophyllum abietinum, and Gloeophyllum trabeum.\n\nWhile some species have unique features, they generally have a similar appearance, with brownish, tough, and leathery fruiting bodies.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of these fungi are typically in the form of brackets or crusts that grow on decaying wood.\n\nFungi within the Gloeophyllales order are not considered edible due to their tough, leathery texture, and potential toxicity.\n\nThe spores of these fungi are usually cylindrical to allantoid (sausage-shaped) and are produced in basidia within the fruiting body.\n\nGloeophyllales species are not typically used for medicinal or culinary purposes, although research into their enzyme production could lead to potential industrial applications.\n\nGloeophyllales fungi help recycle nutrients within forest ecosystems by breaking down complex plant materials and returning them to the soil.\n\nDue to their ecological importance, conservation efforts should focus on preserving natural habitats where these fungi thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the Gloeophyllales order contains essential decomposers in forest ecosystems, characterized by their brown rot-causing abilities and the production of extracellular enzymes. While not edible, these fungi have the potential for industrial applications due to their unique enzymatic properties.\n\nAs a whole, Gloeophyllales fungi play a significant role in maintaining the health and balance of forest ecosystems, making them an essential component of the natural world.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.229Z","title":"Gloeophyllales - Глеофилловые - Gloeophyllales - Gloeophyllales"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphales","folders":[{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20abietina","counters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20abietina\/thumbs\/DSC07245.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Рамария еловая - Ramaria abietina","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:20.311Z"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B6%D1%91%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20flava","counters":{"total":12,"images":12,"files":12},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B6%D1%91%D0%BB%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20flava\/thumbs\/DSC00672.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Рамария жёлтая - Ramaria flava","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:20.580Z"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20formosa","counters":{"total":2,"images":2,"files":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20formosa\/thumbs\/fungi-0004127.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Рамария красивая - Ramaria formosa","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:20.589Z"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20stricta","counters":{"total":17,"images":17,"files":17},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20stricta\/thumbs\/0DSC00595.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Рамария прямая - Ramaria stricta","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:52:22.709Z"}],"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gomphaceae\/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ramaria%20stricta\/thumbs\/0DSC00595.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Гомфовые - Gomphaceae","comment":"The Gomphaceae are a diverse family of fungi belonging in what is classically known as the Phallales or cladistically as the gomphoid-phalloid clade.

This artificial but often useful grouping is now more generally called the hydnoid or tooth fungi. In the strict, modern sense, the Hydnaceae are limited to the genus Hydnum and related genera, with basidiocarps having a toothed or poroid hymenium. Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants.

Trametes trogii","comment":"Trametes trogii, known as Trog's Trametes or Trog-Tramete in German, is a polypore mushroom belonging to the family Polyporaceae. The fruiting body of this fungus typically forms semicircular or fan-shaped caps, measuring 4-15 cm wide and 2-4 cm thick.\n\nThe cap surface is covered with concentric zones of various colors, such as white, gray, or light brown, and may have a hairy or velvety texture. The cap margin is typically wavy and thin.\n\nOn the underside, the pore surface is white, turning to a cream or pale yellowish color with age. The pores are small and round, measuring 2-4 pores per millimeter.\n\nThe flesh of T. trogii is white, corky, and tough. It has a mild or slightly sweet odor, but is considered inedible due to its tough, woody texture.\n\nTrametes trogii is a wood-decay fungus, primarily found on dead hardwood trees, such as beech, oak, and maple. It is a white-rot fungus, breaking down lignin and cellulose in wood.\n\nThis species has a widespread distribution, occurring in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia and South America.\n\nTrog's Trametes generally fruits from late summer to late autumn, depending on local climate conditions.\n\nThe spores of Trametes trogii are ellipsoid, measuring 5-7 x 2-3 micrometers, with a white spore print.\n\nSome research has shown that T. trogii contains bioactive compounds with potential medicinal properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities.\n\nThe mushroom has also been studied for its ability to break down various pollutants, such as dyes and heavy metals, indicating its potential use in bioremediation processes.\n\nTrog's Trametes can be confused with other Trametes species, such as Trametes versicolor or Trametes hirsuta, which have similar appearances. Careful examination of pore size and color can help differentiate these species.","fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:47:04.746Z","title":"Trametes trogii - Траметес Трога - Trog's Trametes - Trog-Tramete"}],"counters":{"total":15,"folders":15},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Polyporaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%20%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Pycnoporus%20cinnabarinus\/thumbs\/DSC03712.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Полипоровые - Polyporaceae","comment":"The Polyporaceae are a family of poroid fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota.

They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These gilled mushrooms are characterised by the brittle flesh of their fruitbodies.\nIn addition to these typical agaricoid forms, the family contains species with fruitbodies that are laterally striped (pleurotoid), closed (secotioid or gasteroid), or crust-like (corticioid). Molecular phylogenetics has demonstrated close affinities between species with very different fruitbody types and has discovered new, distinct lineages.\nAn important group of root-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in forests and shrublands around the world includes Lactifluus, Multifurca, Russula, and Lactarius. The crust-forming genera Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma, all wood-decay fungi, have basal positions in the family.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.509Z","title":"Сыроежковые - Russulaceae"}],"counters":{"total":6,"folders":6},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Russulales\/%D0%A1%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Russulaceae\/%D0%A1%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Russula%20rubra\/thumbs\/fungi-0000021.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Сыроежковые - Russulales","comment":"The Russulales are an order of the Agaricomycetes, (which include the agaric genera Russula and Lactarius and their polyporoid and corticioid relatives).

This diverse group contains over 17,000 described species, including many well-known mushrooms, such as agarics, boletes, and polypores.\n\nThe hallmark feature of Agaricomycetes is the presence of gills, pores, or other spore-producing structures called hymenophores, which are located on the underside of the fruiting body, or cap.\n\nFruiting bodies of Agaricomycetes are highly diverse, ranging from small, inconspicuous forms to large, striking structures. They can be found in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, and are often used to identify species within the group.\n\nThese fungi can be saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, or parasitic, playing important ecological roles in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant health. Some species form symbiotic relationships with plants, while others cause diseases in trees or crops.\n\nAgaricomycetes inhabit a wide range of environments, from forests and grasslands to urban areas and even arctic tundras. Some species are highly adaptable, while others have specific habitat requirements.\n\nThe spores of Agaricomycetes are produced on the hymenophore structures and are typically dispersed by wind, water, or animal activity. Spore size, shape, and color can be crucial for species identification.\n\nAgaricomycetes can reproduce sexually, through the fusion of compatible mating types, or asexually, through spore production and germination.\n\nSome Agaricomycetes species are highly prized for their culinary and medicinal properties, such as the edible Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) and the medicinal Ganoderma lucidum (reishi mushroom).\n\nOther species, like the deadly Amanita phalloides (death cap), produce potent toxins that can cause severe poisoning or even death if ingested.\n\nAgaricomycetes fungi have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, with modern research uncovering potential applications in cancer treatment, immune system modulation, and neuroprotection.\n\nIn addition to their ecological and medical importance, Agaricomycetes species contribute to the field of biotechnology, with applications in waste management, biofuel production, and the development of novel materials.\n\nSpecies within the Agaricomycetes class can be indicators of ecosystem health, with certain species being sensitive to pollution, habitat degradation, or climate change.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to protect rare or endangered Agaricomycetes species and their habitats, as these fungi play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem balance.","dates":{"added":1703524415,"dateRange":{"0":1190484620,"1":1703072220}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.203Z","title":"Agaricomycetes - Агарикомицеты - Gilled Fungi - Blätterpilze"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Pezizomycetes","folders":[{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pezizales","folders":[{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Helvellaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20acetabulum","counters":{"total":33,"images":33,"files":33},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20acetabulum\/thumbs\/0SET09003.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Лопастник бокальчатый - Helvella acetabulum","comment":"Helvella acetabulum, commonly known as the Vinegar Cup or Essigbecher-Helmling in German, is an ascomycete fungus belonging to the family Helvellaceae. This distinctive fungus features a cup-shaped or goblet-shaped fruiting body, usually ranging from 3 to 10 cm in diameter.\n\nThe exterior of the fruiting body is brownish-gray to black, while the interior is a lighter gray. The upper margin of the cup is often irregular, with lobes or folds, giving the fungus a unique appearance.\n\nThe stem of H. acetabulum is typically 4-10 cm long and 1-2 cm thick, and it is hollow, ridged, and wrinkled. The color of the stem can vary from whitish-gray to brownish-black.\n\nHelvella acetabulum is a saprobic fungus, playing a vital role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems. It is often found in deciduous and mixed forests, particularly in areas with abundant leaf litter or woody debris.\n\nThis fungus has a wide geographic distribution, spanning across North America, Europe, and Asia. In some regions, it is more commonly found at higher elevations.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of H. acetabulum typically appear from late summer to autumn, depending on the region and local climate conditions.\n\nThe spores of Helvella acetabulum are elliptical, hyaline, and contain multiple oil droplets. They measure approximately 18-22 x 10-12 micrometers in size.\n\nAscospores are produced in asci, which are sac-like structures within the fruiting body, and are forcibly discharged into the air for dispersal.\n\nAlthough the Vinegar Cup is not considered poisonous, it is generally regarded as inedible due to its tough, leathery texture and unappealing taste.\n\nThere is limited information regarding the chemical compounds present in H. acetabulum, but similar species within the Helvellaceae family are known to contain various secondary metabolites.\n\nHelvella acetabulum has not been extensively studied for its potential medicinal properties, but research on related species suggests that some members of the Helvellaceae family may possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antimicrobial activities.\n\nIt is essential to accurately identify H. acetabulum, as some other cup fungi within the Helvellaceae family can be toxic.","fileDate":"2023-05-06T17:47:04.737Z","title":"Helvella acetabulum - Лопастник бокальчатый - Vinegar Cup - Essigbecher-Helmling"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20lacunosa","counters":{"total":2,"images":2,"files":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Helvella%20lacunosa\/thumbs\/fungi-0004148.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Лопастник бороздчатый - Helvella lacunosa","comment":"Helvella lacunosa, also known as the Fluted Black Elfin Saddle or Gefurchter Lerchensporn in German, is a species of fungi belonging to the Helvellaceae family.

This fungus is known to occur in Europe and North America, particularly in temperate regions with a preference for moist habitats. Pezizella alniella primarily grows on decaying wood or the bark of deciduous trees, particularly alder (Alnus) species.\n\nThe fruiting bodies, or apothecia, of Pezizella alniella are small and disc-shaped, typically measuring between 0.5 to 2 mm in diameter. They exhibit a cream or pale beige color, which may darken to light brown with age. The surface of the apothecia is often smooth and somewhat translucent.\n\nThe asci of Pezizella alniella contain eight spores each, similar to other fungi in the Ascomycota phylum.

This fungus is known to occur in North America and Europe, particularly in temperate regions with moist environments. Coccomyces hiemalis primarily infects the leaves of deciduous trees and shrubs, such as Prunus and Rosa species, causing a leaf spot disease.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Coccomyces hiemalis, called apothecia, appear as small, circular to irregular, black or dark brown spots on the surface of infected leaves. These spots typically measure 1 to 3 mm in diameter and may coalesce, forming larger patches on the leaf surface. The fungus overwinters on fallen leaves and releases spores during the following spring, which then infect new leaves.\n\nThe asci of Coccomyces hiemalis typically contain eight spores each, a characteristic feature of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum. The spores are elliptical in shape, measuring approximately 10-15 x 4-6 µm, and are hyaline, which makes them almost transparent. Each spore typically has one septum, or crosswall, that divides it into separate cells.\n\nCoccomyces hiemalis is considered a plant pathogen, causing leaf spot disease in various deciduous trees and shrubs. While the disease can lead to unsightly leaf spots, premature leaf drop, and reduced photosynthesis, it rarely causes significant harm to the overall health of the plant. In some cases, however, severe infections may result in reduced growth or defoliation.\n\nAs Coccomyces hiemalis is a plant pathogen and not a mushroom-forming fungus, it is not edible. Its primary importance lies in its impact on the health of deciduous trees and shrubs and as a subject of study for plant pathologists, mycologists, and naturalists.\n\nTo manage leaf spot disease caused by Coccomyces hiemalis, it is recommended to collect and dispose of infected leaves during the fall season, which helps to reduce the source of inoculum and limit the spread of the fungus to new leaves in the following year.

It has been reported in various regions across North America and Europe, particularly in areas where these Vaccinium species are native or cultivated.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Rhytisma vaccinii, called apothecia, appear as dark, tar-like spots on the surface of infected leaves. These spots may be surrounded by a yellowish or reddish halo, giving the infected leaves a distinctive appearance. The fungus overwinters on fallen leaves and releases spores during the following spring, which then infect new leaves.\n\nThe asci of Rhytisma vaccinii typically contain eight spores each, a characteristic feature of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum. The spores are elongated and needle-shaped, measuring approximately 40-70 x 1-2 µm, and are hyaline, which makes them almost transparent. They often appear in clusters or fascicles.\n\nRhytisma vaccinii is considered a plant pathogen, causing tar spot disease in Vaccinium species. While the disease can lead to unsightly leaf spots and potentially reduce photosynthesis, it rarely causes significant harm to the overall health of the plant. However, in some cases, severe infections may result in reduced growth, defoliation, or decreased fruit yield.\n\nAs Rhytisma vaccinii is a plant pathogen and not a mushroom-forming fungus, it is not edible. Its primary importance lies in its impact on the health of Vaccinium plants and as a subject of study for plant pathologists, mycologists, and naturalists.\n\nTo manage tar spot disease caused by Rhytisma vaccinii, it is recommended to collect and dispose of infected leaves during the fall season, which helps to reduce the source of inoculum and limit the spread of the fungus to new leaves in the following year.

The class contains a diverse range of fungi with varied ecological roles, including plant pathogens, mycorrhizal symbionts, and saprotrophs.\n\nMany Leotiomycetes fungi have a cup-shaped or apothecial fruiting body, which produces spores for reproduction. The fruiting bodies can be small and inconspicuous, or large and showy, depending on the species.\n\nSome well-known plant pathogens within Leotiomycetes include the powdery mildew fungi, which affect a wide range of plants, and the apple scab fungus (Venturia inaequalis), which can cause significant economic losses in the apple industry.\n\nLeotiomycetes fungi also play important roles in mycorrhizal symbioses, forming mutually beneficial relationships with the roots of many plant species. These fungi can improve the uptake of nutrients by the plant and help protect against soil-borne pathogens.\n\nResearch on the ecology, taxonomy, and physiology of Leotiomycetes fungi aids in understanding their distribution, virulence, and potential applications. Some species within this class may have potential applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research due to their unique secondary metabolites.\n\nIn summary, Leotiomycetes is a class of fungi containing a diverse range of species with varied ecological roles. These include plant pathogens, mycorrhizal symbionts, and saprotrophs.

Sordariomycetes is from the Latin sordes (filth) because some species grow in animal feces, though growth habits vary widely across the class.\nSordariomycetes generally produce their asci in perithecial fruiting bodies.\nSordariomycetes are also known as Pyrenomycetes, from the Greek πυρἠν - 'the stone of a fruit' - because of the usually somewhat tough texture of their tissue.\nSordariomycetes possess great variability in morphology, growth form, and habitat. Most have perithecial (flask-shaped) fruiting bodies, but ascomata can be less frequently cleistothecial (like in the genera Anixiella, Apodus, Boothiella, Thielavia, Zopfiella),. Fruiting bodies may be solitary or gregarious, superficial, or immersed within stromata or tissues of the substrates and can be light to bright or black. Members of this group can grow in soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood as decomposers, as well as being fungal parasites, and insect, human, and plant pathogens.","dates":{"added":1680916161,"dateRange":{"0":1232307829,"1":1679751452}},"fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.211Z","title":"Сордариомицеты - Sordariomycetes"},{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Dacrymycetes","folders":[{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Dacrymycetales","folders":[{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Dacrymycetaceae","folders":[{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20chrysospermus","counters":{"total":4,"images":4,"files":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20chrysospermus\/thumbs\/fungi-0003773.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Дакримицес золотистоспоровый - Dacrymyces chrysospermus","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:51.957Z"},{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20stillatus","counters":{"total":4,"images":4,"files":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20stillatus\/thumbs\/fungi-0004161.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Дакримицес исчезающий - Dacrymyces stillatus","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:51.973Z"},{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20palmatus","counters":{"total":3,"images":3,"files":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20palmatus\/thumbs\/fungi-0003591.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Дакримицес ладоневидный - Dacrymyces palmatus","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:51.989Z"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Calocera%20viscosa","counters":{"total":8,"images":8,"files":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Calocera%20viscosa\/thumbs\/DSC05310.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Калоцера клейкая - Calocera viscosa","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:52.229Z"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Calocera%20cornea","counters":{"total":9,"images":9,"files":9},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Calocera%20cornea\/thumbs\/DSC00357.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Калоцера роговидная - Calocera cornea","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:53:52.298Z"}],"counters":{"total":5,"folders":5},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Dacrymycetaceae\/%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%20%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9%20-%20Dacrymyces%20stillatus\/thumbs\/fungi-0004161.webp","width":512,"height":410},"name":"Дакримицетовые - Dacrymycetaceae","comment":"The Dacrymycetes are a class consisting of only one family of jelly fungi, which has imperforate parenthesomes and basidia that are usually branched.

Trichiales is one of five orders in the group Myxomycetes (also called Myxogastria), or the true plasmodial slime molds. It is also currently categorized under the superorder Lucisporidia with its sister group, Liceales. The order was first described by Thomas MacBride in 1922, and has retained the same name and status as a defined order in present phylogeny. In the plasmodium form, members of Trichiales lack a columella but have a well-developed capillitium for spore dispersal. The shape and details of the capillitium are used to define families within the order. Spores are brightly coloured, ranging from clear, white and yellow to pink and red-brown tones. The order currently has 4 families, 14 genera and 174 species.

However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants. In addition, most rust fungi cannot be grown easily in pure culture.\nA single species of rust fungi may be able to infect two different plant hosts in different stages of its life cycle, and may produce up to five morphologically and cytologically distinct spore-producing structures viz., spermogonia, aecia, uredinia, telia, and basidia in successive stages of reproduction.

By a 2008 estimate it contains 23 families, 332 genera and more than 4700 species. The majority of species are saprobes on decaying plant material in fresh water, marine, or terrestrial environments, but several species are also associated with living plants as parasites, epiphytes or endophytes. The best studied species cause plant diseases on important agricultural crops e.g. Cochliobolus heterostrophus, causing southern corn leaf blight on maize, Phaeosphaeria nodorum (Stagonospora nodorum) causing glume blotch on wheat and Leptosphaeria maculans causing a stem canker (called blackleg) on cabbage crops (Brassica). Some species of Pleosporales occur on animal dung and a small number occur as lichens and rock-inhabiting fungi.","fileDate":"2023-02-04T01:49:57.245Z","title":"Плеоспоровые - Pleosporales"}],"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%94%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8B%20-%20Dothideomycetes\/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pleosporales\/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Venturiaceae\/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Venturia%20inaequalis\/thumbs\/DSC05852_.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Дотидеомицеты - Dothideomycetes<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Dothideomycetes is the largest and most diverse class of ascomycete fungi.
